# 2.2 Strategic Domain Design - Loop Chapters Outline

The Loop is the beating heart of PDD. It‚Äôs where business pain turns into clarity, then into a testable bet. Every pass through the loop creates artifacts that answer a specific burning question. Each artifact has an intended audience (the ‚Äúhats‚Äù), and each one keeps the team from drifting into theater or chaos.

## 2.2.0 Loop Overview

**Purpose:** Frame what the Loop is, when to run it, who‚Äôs in the room, and how artifacts flow from one to the next.

* **Audience (hats):** Everyone - business, product, ops, dev leads.
* **Burning questions:** What is the loop? Why do we need it? What does it produce?
* **Why it matters:** Sets the stage. Without this, the following templates feel like busywork instead of a system.

## 2.2.1 Business Pain Point Entry

**Purpose:** Catch the smoke before the fire. Quick intake for new issues.

* **Audience (hats):** Anyone close to the work - support, ops, product, finance, devs.
* **Burning questions:** What hurts? Who‚Äôs feeling it? How bad does it sting?
* **Why it matters:** If pain isn‚Äôt captured clearly, you‚Äôll chase the wrong problems later.

---

## 2.2.2 Problem Validation Brief

**Purpose:** Separate real fires from false alarms. Gather evidence and quantify the pain.

* **Audience (hats):** Product, analytics, finance, ops leads.
* **Burning questions:** Is this pain real? Can we prove it? What‚Äôs the cost if we ignore it?
* **Why it matters:** Prevents zombie projects based on anecdotes or politics.

---

## 2.2.3 Vision & Problem Statement

**Purpose:** Paint the better world and tie it to strategy.

* **Audience (hats):** Business owner, product, finance, compliance, ops.
* **Burning questions:** Where do we want to go? Why now? How does it tie to company goals?
* **Why it matters:** Vision without measures is fluff. This anchors the work in business reality.

---

## 2.2.4 Requirements Brief

**Purpose:** Turn vision into business-level requirements that are clear, scoped, and testable.

* **Audience (hats):** Product, business owner, QA, ops, dev lead.
* **Burning questions:** What must be in/out of scope? What business rules and constraints matter? What risks are lurking?
* **Why it matters:** Keeps scope creep in check and defines what ‚Äúdone‚Äù really means.

---

## 2.2.5 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Purpose:** Package the business solution in a way that‚Äôs ready for tactical translation.

* **Audience (hats):** Product, business owner, QA, dev lead, ops, compliance.
* **Burning questions:** What solution are we betting on? What rules and capabilities must exist? How will we measure success?
* **Why it matters:** This is the last stop before the tactical side takes over. If it‚Äôs fuzzy here, it‚Äôll be chaos later.

---

## 2.2.6 Crosswalk to Tactical (Preview)

**Purpose:** Show how strategic artifacts feed the technical baseline and backlog.

* **Audience (hats):** Dev leads, product, ops.
* **Burning questions:** How do these docs map to code? What do devs actually pick up?
* **Why it matters:** Prevents the dreaded handoff gap where business docs vanish and devs guess.

üëâ In short: The Loop isn‚Äôt paperwork - it‚Äôs a decision engine. Each artifact asks a burning question, each answer drives alignment, and the whole system keeps teams honest while still moving fast.
