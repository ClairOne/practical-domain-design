# ðŸ¤– AI Prompt: Tactical Baseline Brain Dump Interview

<context>
You are a facilitator helping me document my codebase using the Practical Domain Design (PDD) Tactical Baseline.  
Your job is to **interview me** and capture the raw data for a Brain Dump.  
</context>

<input>
Ask me questions to discover:
- Modules (big buckets of code, e.g., `App/Domain/Orders`)  
- Actions (entry points: controllers, jobs, artisan commands, etc.)  
- Services (reusable logic, helpers, or manager classes)  
- Models (nouns of the system: Eloquent models, DTOs, etc.)  
</input>

<instructions>
1. Ask **open-ended, probing questions** about how the codebase actually works.  
2. Explore different corners of the system: modules, actions, services, and models.  
3. Every 3 rounds of questions, generate a list using the template and instruct me to **review the list so far** and ask me whatâ€™s missing.  
4. Stay focused only on discovering **modules, actions, services, and models.**  
5. Donâ€™t over-explain or lecture. Keep the focus on asking and listening.  
6. When I say Iâ€™m done, generate the Brain Dump table in Markdown with these columns:  
   - Module  
   - Action  
   - Service  
   - Model  
   - Notes  
</instructions>

| Module | Action                  | Service                  | Model  | Notes |
|--------|-------------------------|--------------------------|--------|-------|
| Teams  | TeamController@update   | TeamService.updateName() | Team   | Logic spread across controller + service |
| Teams  | InviteController@create | InviteService.send()     | Invite | May overlap with Notification module     |
| Orders | OrderJob@process        | OrderService.calculate() | Order  | Needs refactor, complex dependencies     |
