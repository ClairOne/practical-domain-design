# ðŸ”Ž Query Map

A tactical doc for codebases without formal Service/Model layers. Shows where queries live, how theyâ€™re used, and what business meaning they carry.

---

## Table(s) Involved

* `[table_1]`
* `[table_2]`

---

## 1. Query Inventory

| Location          | Query Snippet              | Type (Read/Write) | Notes (Business Meaning) |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| File.php:45       | `SELECT ... FROM invoices` | Read              | List invoices for a user |
| OtherFile.php:102 | `INSERT INTO payments ...` | Write             | Record payment event     |

---

## 2. Grouped by Table

### `[table_name]`

* **Reads:**

  * `[path:line]` - short description
* **Writes:**

  * `[path:line]` - short description

---

## 3. Joins & Relationships

* `invoices` joined with `users` on `user_id`
* `invoice_items` joined with `products` on `product_id`

---

## 4. Hotspots

> High-traffic or high-risk queries that deserve extra attention.

* `[path:line]` - N+1 risk
* `[path:line]` - Critical write on payment flow

---

ðŸ‘‰ **In short:** Query Maps document *how a table is used in the code*. For *what the table is*, see the Table Spec.

<instructions>
1. Ask the user to provide the table-spec if it's not already available!
2. Ask the user which operating system they are on (Linux, macOS, Windows).
3. Provide them with the appropriate command-line search to scan their codebase for references to the table. Examples:
   - **Linux/macOS:** `grep -rn "table_name" ./path/to/codebase`
   - **Windows (PowerShell):** `Select-String -Path .\path\to\codebase\* -Pattern "table_name" -Recurse`
4. Ask the user to paste the search results.
5. use the template and fill it out with only confirmed known data
