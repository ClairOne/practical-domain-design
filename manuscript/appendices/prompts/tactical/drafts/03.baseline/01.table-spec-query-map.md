## Table: `[table_name]`

**Description:** {What this table represents in the business - plain English, not DB jargon}

---

## 1. Table Structure

```sql
{insert the create statement here}
```

---

## 2. Keys & Timestamps

* **Primary Key:** `[column_name]`
* **Timestamps:**

  * Created: `[created_at | none]`
  * Updated: `[updated_at | none]`
  * Soft Delete: `[deleted_at | none]`

---

## 3. Data Access Pattern

* **ORM in use?** \[Yes/No]

  * If yes:

    * Library: `[Eloquent, Doctrine, etc.]`
    * Model file: `[path/to/Model.php]`
    * Model class: `[ClassName]`
  * If no:

    * Pattern: `[Repository, Raw SQL, QueryObject, Other]`
    * Key files:

      * `[path/to/file1]`
      * `[path/to/file2]`

---

## 4. Joins

* Joins with `[other_table]` on `[foreign_key]`
* Joins with `[other_table]` on `[foreign_key]`

---

## 5. Indexes

* **Primary Key:** `[pk_name] ([column])`
* **Unique Indexes:**

  * `[index_name] ([col1, col2])` - reason/purpose
* **Other Indexes:**

  * `[index_name] ([col])` - query support notes

---

## 6. Column Stats

| Column       | Data Type | Size/Precision | Nullable | Default            | Description    |
| ------------ | --------- | -------------- | -------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| `id`         | bigint    | 20             | NO       | auto\_increment    | Primary key    |
| `status`     | varchar   | 50             | NO       | 'pending'          | Invoice status |
| `created_at` | timestamp | -              | YES      | CURRENT\_TIMESTAMP | Creation time  |

---

ðŸ‘‰ **In short:** Table Specs document *what a table is* and *how itâ€™s wired*. For *how itâ€™s used*, see the linked Query Map.
</template>
<template>
# ðŸ”Ž Query Map

A tactical doc for codebases without formal Service/Model layers. Shows where queries live, how they're used, and what business meaning they carry.

---

## Table(s) Involved

* `[table_1]`
* `[table_2]`

---

## 1. Query Operations

### Create

| Location          | Query Snippet              | Notes (Business Meaning) |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| File.php:67       | `INSERT INTO invoices ...` | Create new invoice       |

### Read

| Location          | Query Snippet              | Notes (Business Meaning) |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| File.php:45       | `SELECT ... FROM invoices` | List invoices for a user |
| OtherFile.php:102 | `SELECT ... FROM payments` | Payment lookup           |

### Update

| Location          | Query Snippet              | Notes (Business Meaning) |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| File.php:89       | `UPDATE invoices SET ...`  | Update invoice status    |

### Delete

| Location          | Query Snippet              | Notes (Business Meaning) |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| File.php:123      | `DELETE FROM invoices ...` | Remove cancelled invoice |

### Other

| Location          | Query Snippet              | Notes (Business Meaning) |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| File.php:145      | `CALL stored_proc(...)`    | Complex business logic   |

---

## 2. Joins & Relationships

* `invoices` joined with `users` on `user_id`
* `invoice_items` joined with `products` on `product_id`

---

## 3. Hotspots

> High-traffic or high-risk queries that deserve extra attention.

* `[path:line]` - N+1 risk
* `[path:line]` - Critical write on payment flow

---

ðŸ‘‰ **In short:** Query Maps document *how a table is used in the code*. For *what the table is*, see the Table Spec.
</template>
<references>
1 CREATE TABLE statement
2 grep search results
</references>
<instructions>
1. ask the user to provide the create table statement
2. after they provide the create statement ask them to run the following command line in the root of the repo
grep -rn --include='*.php' "{table name}" > pdd/table-maps/{table name}.grep.txt
and paste the results in the chat.
3. generate the 'table spec' doc in a new canvas
4. generate the 'query map' doc in a new canvas

The audience are technical people. do not add extra fluff. keep your questions brief and to the point. include only the specifics outlined in the instructions.
