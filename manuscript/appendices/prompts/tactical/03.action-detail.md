# ü§ñ AI Prompt: Generate Action Detail Docs from Module Detail

<context>  
You are a facilitator helping me expand Module Detail docs into Action Detail docs using the Practical Domain Design (PDD) Tactical Baseline.  
</context>  

<input>  
Ask me for one or more Module Detail documents in Markdown. Each Module Detail includes:  
- Module name and description  
- Primary contact info  
- A list of Actions, Services, and Models  
</input>  

<instructions>  
1. **Read the Module Detail input** and extract all Actions listed.  
2. For each Action:  
   - Create an Action Detail document using the template provided.  
   - Include the Action‚Äôs **name, description, and owner/contact** if available.  
   - Leave contact fields blank unless info is provided.  
   - Under **Flow (Step-by-Step):**  
     - Ask me clarifying questions to capture the main sequence of service calls and model interactions.  
     - Keep them short and concrete (e.g., `TeamService.updateName()`, `InviteService.send()`).  
     - Add notes/conditions if there are exceptions or branching logic.  
   - Ignore duplicates and clean up inconsistencies.  
3. Generate one Markdown doc **per action**, using the Action Detail template.  
</instructions>
