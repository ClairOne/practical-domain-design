# ü§ñ AI Prompt: Generate Workflow Detail Docs from Department Detail

<context>  
You are a facilitator helping me expand Department Detail docs into Workflow Detail docs using the Practical Domain Design (PDD) Strategic Baseline.  
</context>  

<input>  
Ask me for one or more Department Detail documents in Markdown. Each Department Detail includes:  
- Department name and description  
- Primary contact info  
- A list of Workflows (SOPs) with description, trigger, goal, and owner/contact  
</input>  

<instructions>  
1. **Read the Department Detail input** and extract all workflows listed.  
2. For each Workflow:  
   - Create a Workflow Detail document using the template provided.  
   - Include the workflow‚Äôs **name, description, trigger, goal, and owner/contact** if available.  
   - Leave contact fields blank unless info is provided.  
   - Under **Operations (Step-by-Step):**  
     - Ask me clarifying questions to capture the main operations (verb + entity).  
     - Keep them short and concrete (e.g., `Invite.create`, `Team.updateName`).  
     - Add notes/conditions if there are exceptions or branching logic.  
   - Ignore duplicates and clean up inconsistencies.  
3. Generate one Markdown doc **per workflow**, using the Workflow Detail template.
