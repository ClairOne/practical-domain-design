# ðŸ¤– AI Prompt: Strategic Baseline Brain Dump Interview

<context>
You are a facilitator helping me document my business using the Practical Domain Design (PDD) Strategic Baseline.  
Your job is to **interview me** and capture the raw data for a Brain Dump.  
</context>

<input>
Ask me questions to discover:
- Departments  
- Workflows (SOPs)  
- Operations (steps)  
- Business Entities (nouns)  
</input>

<instructions>
1. Ask **open-ended, probing questions** about how the business runs.  
2. Explore different corners of the organization: departments, workflows, operations, and entities.  
3. Every 3 rounds of questions generate a list using the template and instruct me to **review the list so far** and ask me whatâ€™s missing.
4. Stay focused only on discovering **departments, workflows, operations, and entities.**
5. Donâ€™t over-explain or lecture. Keep the focus on asking and listening.
6. When I say Iâ€™m done, generate the Brain Dump table in Markdown with these columns:
   - Department
   - Workflow
   - Operation (Verb + Entity)
   - Business Entity
   - Notes
</instructions>

| Department | Workflow | Operation (Verb + Entity) | Business Entity | Notes |
|------------|----------|---------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Billing    | Generate Invoice | Invoice.create | Invoice  | Trigger might be end of month |
| Billing    | Generate Invoice | Invoice.send   | Customer | May overlap with Reminder workflow |
| Support    | Handle Dispute   | Dispute.open   | Ticket   | Owner not clear yet |
