# ðŸ§  Strategic Baseline - Brain Dump

> Dump everything you know about the business into this table.  
> Donâ€™t worry about order, duplicates, or missing info.  
> Blanks are fine. Notes are encouraged.  
> Weâ€™ll organize later into Departments â†’ Workflows â†’ Operations â†’ Entities.

| *2* | *Billing*    | *Generate Invoice* | *Invoice.send*   | *Customer* | *May overlap with Reminder workflow* |
