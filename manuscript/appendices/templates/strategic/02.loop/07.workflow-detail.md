# ðŸ§© Workflow Detail - Loop

**Workflow Name:** `[Name of workflow]`
**Department:** `[Owning department]`
**Owner:** `[Actual human name]`
**Role:** `[Ownerâ€™s department role]`
**Source PRD:** `[Link to the single PRD driving this loop]`

## 1. Description

`[Plain-language description of the workflow in the context of this pain point]`

---

## 2. Purpose & Flow

### Trigger(s):
`[Event or condition(s) that start this workflow]`

### Goal:
`[What the workflow is trying to accomplish]`

### Outcome:
`[End state this workflow achieves for this pain point]`

### Output Artifact(s):

| Artifact | Owner (Role) | Required / Optional | Notes |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ----- |
|          |              |                     |       |

---

## 3. Operational Steps

List the operations that make up this workflow. Each operation should be captured at a high level here, with detailed information stored in the **Operation Detail** document.

| Step | Operation (Verb + Entity) | Notes                                |
| ---- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 1    | `Team.create`             | Creates a new team record            |
| 2    | `Team.addCoach`           | Links a coach to a team              |
| 3    | `Team.update`             | Updates details for an existing team |

ðŸ‘‰ If the workflow requires stopping or waiting on something external, split it into multiple workflows instead of forcing a pause mid-stream.

---

## 4. Entities Impacted (For This Loop)

List the key entities this workflow touches. Detailed rules about what happens to each entity belong in the **Entity Detail** document.

| Entity | What Happens (at workflow level)               |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Team   | Created and updated as part of team management |
| Coach  | Added and associated with a team               |

---

## 5. Workflow-Level Rules & Context

### Business Rules:

| Rule ID | Rule Description | Source / Justification | Notes |
| ------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- | ----- |
| BR-1    |                  |                        |       |

### Contextual Considerations:
`[Conditions that apply to the workflow as a whole, not individual operations]`

### Cross-Department Involvement:
`[Other departments or workflows this one interacts with]`

---

## 6. Risks & Conflict Check

### Overlaps:

Does this workflow overlap/conflict with another?

| ID | Description | Potential Impact | Notes |
| -- | ----------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| 1  |             |                  |       |

### Edge Cases:

Conditions that could break the workflow, e.g., team deletion mid-season

| ID | Description | Potential Impact | Notes |
| -- | ----------- | ---------------- | ----- |
| 1  |             |                  |       |

### Mitigation Notes:
`[How conflicts should be handled]`

---

## 7. Example Scenarios

### Happy Path:
`[Walkthrough of the normal case for this workflow]`

### Conflict Case:
`[Case where another workflow or rule creates a conflict]`

### Cross-Department Touch:
`[Case where two depts interact through this workflow]`

---

## 8. Dependencies

`[Other workflows, departments, or systems this loop depends on]`
| Dependency | Type (Workflow/System/Dept) | Criticality (H/M/L) | Notes |
| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------------- | ----- |
|            |                             |                     |       |

ðŸ‘‰ **In short:** This template treats a workflow as a unit of work that runs start to finish. It lists operations, entities, and roles at a high level, while pushing detailed rules into their own Operation or Entity Detail docs. That separation makes it easier to manage conflicts across loops and maintain version control for Strategic documentation.
