# ðŸ”Ž Query Map

A tactical doc for codebases without formal Service/Model layers. Shows where queries live, how they're used, and what business meaning they carry.

## Table(s) Involved

## 2. Joins & Relationships

* `invoices` joined with `users` on `user_id`
* `invoice_items` joined with `products` on `product_id`

---

## 3. Hotspots

> High-traffic or high-risk queries that deserve extra attention.

* `[path:line]` - N+1 risk
* `[path:line]` - Critical write on payment flow
