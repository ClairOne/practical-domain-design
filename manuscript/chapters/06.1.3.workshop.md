# 6.1.3 Workshop: Establish The Strategic Baseline - Documenting the Business

This agenda gives you a practical way to run the Strategic Baseline SOP (6.b) as a live workshop with your team. Time-boxed, structured, and designed to get from nothing → validated artifacts in one session.


---

## 🕘 9:00 – Kickoff (15 min)

- Welcome the group.
- Explain the goal: *“By lunch, we’ll have a clear map of how the business actually works, broken down by department.”*
- Quick overview of the process: Brain dump → Deep dive → Present & review.


---

## 📝 9:15 – Brain Dump Departments & Workflows (45 min)

- Gather everyone in a room with whiteboards or a shared doc projected.
- Step 1: List all departments.
- Step 2: List the main workflows under each department.
- Assign an owner for each department.
- Stop when there’s general agreement on the lists.

**Output:** A master list of departments, owners, and high-level workflows.

## 👥 10:00 – Department Huddles: Deep Dive (60 min)

- Split into department-level groups (still in the same room).
- Each group:
- Breaks workflows into operations.
- Captures entities touched by those operations.
- Assembles a scratchpad map (Dept → Workflows → Operations → Entities).

**Facilitator’s role:** Float between groups, answer questions, keep momentum.

**Output:** Department scratchpad maps.

## 🍴 11:00 – Lunch & Department Presentations (60 min)

- As people eat, department owners present their maps one by one.
- Encourage quick feedback and clarifications from the room:
- “Does this look like reality?”
- “What’s missing?”
- “Who else is impacted by this?”
- Update maps live based on feedback.

**Output:** Validated Department Detail docs.


---

## ✅ 12:00 – Wrap-Up & Next Steps (15 min)

- Recap what was captured.
- Highlight any obvious gaps or lopsided departments (signals for backlog).
- Explain where this leads: *“These baselines set us up for the next PDD phase.”*

**Final Output:** A complete Strategic Baseline across departments, ready for use in the PDD Loop.

👉 In short: Half a day, everyone in one room, real artifacts at the end.
