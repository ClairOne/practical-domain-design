# 1. Introduction: How Small Teams Blow Up Their Own Code

Every small dev team has lived this nightmare:
The business tosses IT a two-sentence “requirement” that might as well be scribbled on a napkin. Developers nod, crank out a proof-of-concept feature, and proudly demo it.

Cue the soundtrack of horror:

- “What the fuck is this?”
- “That’s not how we do it.”
- “What about this?”

Suddenly the feature is wrong, the clock is ticking, and the team is rewriting code while silently muttering, “We’ll clean that up later.” Spoiler: later never comes.

Layer this on for a few years and you’ve built a monument to tech debt. The code is brittle, tangled, and allergic to change. Marketing is still selling shiny new features. Developers are quietly updating their résumés. Leadership eventually panics and swaps out IT heads like that will magically fix the mess. The next “big idea” is always the same: *Let’s rewrite everything from scratch - V2 will save us.* And somehow, it only makes things worse.

This isn’t a one-off story. It’s the repeating cycle of small software teams everywhere. And Domain Driven Design (DDD), despite its brilliance, often makes the gap worse. Why? Because it insists on one “ubiquitous language” - and business folks aren’t buying it.

That’s where Practical Domain Design (PDD) steps in. We don’t force business and developers into the same dictionary. We let each side keep speaking their own language, then build a clear, no-bullshit translation map between them.

PDD isn’t about elegance. It’s about survival. It’s about turning chaotic ideas into boringly predictable, stable releases. And yes, *boring* is the goal. Because software delivery should be routine, not a stress factory powered by duct tape and crossed fingers.
