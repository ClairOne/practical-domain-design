# Strategic PDD - The Language Of Business

Every team thinks they know how the business runs… until they try to write it down. Suddenly, that “simple” billing process has six detours, two unspoken exceptions, and one undocumented spreadsheet only Karen from accounting knows about.

That’s why the Strategic Phase exists. Before we can fix anything, we need a clear snapshot of how the business actually works today - warts, duct tape, and all. Not how it should work, not how leadership likes to present it in slide decks, but how it really runs when customers are calling, orders are piling up, and the system is creaking.

The Strategic Phase has two parts:

Baseline: Document the business - departments, workflows, operations, entities. This is your map of “what is.”

The Loop: Capture pain points against that baseline and build a backlog in business terms. This turns raw complaints into structured inputs for the dev side.

👉 In short: The Strategic Phase is about building a shared reality. No silver bullets, no redesigns yet. Just an honest mirror held up to the business so everyone’s finally looking at the same starting point.
