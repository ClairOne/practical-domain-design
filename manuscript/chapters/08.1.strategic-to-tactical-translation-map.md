| Strategic term            | Tactical - Laravel    | Notes                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Department                | Domain                | Top-level business area and code namespace. Example: `App/Domain/PainPoints`.                                                                             |
| Workflow                  | Action                | Multi-step SOP composed of Operations. Implemented as one coordinating Action that may call other Actions.                                                |
| Operation                 | Service.function      | Single-step unit of business work. E.g. Team.update                                                                                                       |
| Business Entity           | Model                 | The noun of the system. Keep models thin.                                                                                                                 |
| Workflow Request          | ActionInputDTO        | Input to a coordinating Action. Includes step list, dependencies, and handoff expectations.                                                               |
| Workflow Response         | ResultDTO / OutputDTO | Composite business response with run id, final status, and next step hints.                                                                               |
| Operation Request         | ServiceInputDTO       | Input contract for a Service. For Search use criteria DTOs; for Change use command DTOs.                                                                  |
| Operation Response        | ServiceOutputDTO      | Output contract from a Service. Returns entity/view DTOs or paginated sets - never Eloquent models.                                                       |
| Business Input Form       | FormRequest           | Transport-layer validation. Converts to ActionInputDTO.                                                                                                   |
| Access Channel            | Passport Scope        | Broad transport gate - web, api, job, command. Checked at entry. After entry, Permissions + Gates + Policies govern capabilities and records.             |
| Permission                | Spatie Permission     | Named capability entity - role or grant based. No specific record context. Used for UI show/hide and quick guards.                                        |
| Role                      | Spatie Group          | Business role mapped to a Spatie Group that aggregates Permissions for assignment to users.                                                               |
| Access Rule               | Gate                  | Contextual rule at workflow boundaries: combine permissions with runtime context like business hours, feature flags, maintenance mode. Can call Policies. |
| Access Policy             | Policy                | Per-entity decision: ownership, record state, org constraints for a specific instance.                                                                    |

| Business Event Subscriber | Listener              | Handles side effects of Business Signals. Single classification - tactical attributes defined later.                                                      |
| Notification              | Notification          | Messages to humans or channels triggered by Events/Actions.                                                                                               |

### Access control - order of checks

1. **Access Channel - Passport Scope**: can this token enter via web, api, job, or command
2. **Permission - Spatie Permission**: named capability like `team.create`, `team.update`
3. **Access Rule - Gate**: context checks - business hours, feature flags, maintenance
4. **Access Policy - Policy**: record-level rules - ownership, role on team, attribute limits

- Principle: the deeper you go, the more restrictive. Trust at higher layers - verify at lower layers. Lower layers should not depend on the entry channel.
