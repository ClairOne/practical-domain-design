# Chapter 1: Introduction / Overview

**Why another book?**
I designed PDD in response to the problems I‚Äôve run into over a 30-year career in software development. I love the idea of Domain-Driven Design. As a developer, the artifacts of DDD make my job easier. But the constant struggle was getting others to adopt the language and process. It was confusing. It was time consuming. And the Agile misconception that ‚Äúprototyping = rapid development‚Äù just piled tech debt higher and faster.

So I started experimenting. Story maps worked for a while - they gave the business something to visualize and talk about - but they didn‚Äôt have enough structure. People get lost in endless options without a framework to guide them. Over time I collected a grab-bag of tools, tricks, and half-frameworks that solved real problems. I wore every hat - dev, DBA, architect, BA, product owner, mad scientist - and every role left me with another bit of the puzzle.

Those bits stuck. I still hear from people who use tools I built more than a decade ago. And when my current job gave me the freedom to stitch it all together into a single framework and test it with a small team, the feedback was jaw-dropping. Within days the team was shipping cleaner, faster, and with less stress.

I‚Äôve been using the prompts that underpin PDD for weeks now, and the results are nothing short of  amazing. I built a full feature in 48 hours - from idea to production-ready pull request - with full documentation and polish I‚Äôd normally never have time for.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm writing this book. PDD isn‚Äôt theory. It‚Äôs the working framework born out of decades of bruises, stitched together in a way real teams can actually adopt and benefit from.

**Who this book is for**
If you‚Äôre on a small product team, you‚Äôll recognize the chaos: napkin requirements, ops firefights, QA chasing ghosts, devs guessing at business intent. PDD gives you just enough structure to stop the bleeding without slowing you down.

If you‚Äôre in a large enterprise, the pain looks fancier - more Jira tickets, more committees, more slide decks - but it‚Äôs the same disease. Translation fatigue. Decision ping-pong. Models that look great on paper but collapse in production. PDD scales up because the core loop is the same: feedback, thin slices, and making the good stuff canon.

**What this book will teach you**
Here‚Äôs the journey we‚Äôll take together:

1. **Spot the real problem.** Why traditional methods like DDD and ‚ÄúAgile Theater‚Äù break down in practice.
2. **Meet PDD.** The principles and promises that make it work.
3. **Build your baseline.** A simple way to capture where you are today before you try to fix it.
4. **Run the loop.** The feedback cycle that drives learning and prevents late-night disasters.
5. **Make it canon.** How to promote lessons from the loop into your new source of truth.
6. **Keep it alive.** How to deal with drift, growth, and the messy reality of shipping software.

By the end, you won‚Äôt have a binder of theory. You‚Äôll have a handful of living artifacts, a loop your team can actually run, and a way to evolve design without collapsing under it.

**What next**
You‚Äôve got two good options from here: dip into the case studies below to see how this stuff plays out in real, funny, and disastrous contexts - or skip ahead to Chapter 2 to start unpacking the problem space. Either way, you‚Äôre set up to get the most out of what comes next.

üëâ In short: PDD is the antidote to design theater. Whether you‚Äôre a five-person startup or a Fortune 500 death-by-committee machine, the principles are the same: feedback beats foresight, thin slices win, and what works becomes canon.
