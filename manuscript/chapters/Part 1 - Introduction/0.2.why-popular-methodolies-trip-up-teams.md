# Chapter 2: Why Popular Methodologies Trip Up Teams

Software design has been through a parade of ‚Äúbig answers.‚Äù Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), SAFe, LeSS, and countless hybrids with shinier logos. Each came with the promise: *follow these steps and your team will deliver better software, faster, with less pain.*

The problem? Most of these methods look great in books and slide decks, but in practice, teams end up tripping over the same cracks. Some approaches are too rigid. Some are too heavy. Others are elegant in theory but demand a learning curve so steep you need climbing gear.

PDD isn‚Äôt here to throw out everything that came before. It borrows the best pieces. But it also admits what hasn‚Äôt worked in the real world - especially for small teams without a stadium full of coaches and consultants.

## a. The Waterfall Mirage

Waterfall promised clarity: gather all the requirements up front, design once, build once, and roll it out like a factory product.

In practice? Businesses change their mind faster than you can finish a Gantt chart. By the time the last phase is done, the requirements are already out of date. The team ships exactly what was asked for six months ago - and exactly what no one wants today.

## b. Agile & Scrum Fatigue

Agile started as a rebellion against Waterfall‚Äôs rigidity. Scrum gave it structure: sprints, backlogs, standups. At first, it was liberating.

But without discipline, teams drift into **Agile Theater**:

* Standups become status recitals.
* Sprint reviews are awkward half-demos.
* Backlogs balloon into junk drawers.

Instead of speed and collaboration, you get ritual without results. Scrum isn‚Äôt broken - but applied mechanically, it wears teams down.

## c. DDD‚Äôs Steep Hill

Domain-Driven Design was revolutionary when it landed in 2003. It gave developers a way to model messy business problems in code. For practitioners, the artifacts are gold.

The catch? The learning curve. Getting non-developers to adopt the language and process often stalls out. Ubiquitous language sounds great until Sales, Support, and Finance are stuck in a three-hour debate about whether it‚Äôs a *customer* or a *client.*

DDD isn‚Äôt wrong. It was just early. And without simplification, it‚Äôs a barrier for teams trying to move fast.

## d. Framework Inflation

Every few years, a new acronym promises to scale Agile: SAFe, LeSS, Spotify model. These frameworks often solve problems for huge enterprises - but bring overhead most small teams can‚Äôt sustain. Suddenly you‚Äôre spending more time updating artifacts for the framework than solving real business problems.

---

## What these all have in common

* They start with **good intentions.**
* They deliver **value for some teams.**
* But when adopted blindly, they create as much pain as they solve.

Rigid plans collapse when the business shifts. Rituals drift into theater. Elegant ideas stall out under their own weight.

## Where PDD fits

Practical Domain Design isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúreplacement religion.‚Äù It‚Äôs a pragmatic evolution:

* **From DDD:** it keeps the clarity of modeling the domain - without the linguistic dogma.
* **From Agile/Scrum:** it keeps the feedback loops and thin slices - without the theater.
* **With Waterfall:** it can even fit, by using baselines and loops to reduce risk in staged delivery.

The core idea: **feedback beats foresight, thin slices win, and what works becomes canon.**

That makes PDD lightweight enough for a five-person startup, but structured enough to give a 5000-person enterprise real alignment.

üëâ **In short:** Every methodology promised to fix the chaos. Most delivered value - and headaches. PDD builds on what worked, ditches what didn‚Äôt, and gives you a loop you can actually run without a playbook the size of a dictionary.
