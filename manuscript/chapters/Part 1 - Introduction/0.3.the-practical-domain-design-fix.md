# Chapter 3: The Practical Domain Design Fix

So if Waterfall, Agile, Scrum, and DDD each had their strengths, why do teams still keep tripping on them? Because most of these methods are used like it‚Äôs still the era they were born in. Waterfall assumed stable requirements. Agile assumed small, co-located teams. DDD assumed monoliths and long release cycles. The world has changed - APIs everywhere, cloud sprawl, remote everything, and a constant stream of alerts that hit at 2 a.m. Trying to use those methods unmodified today is like trying to run modern apps on a Windows 95 box. They might boot, but the fit is clunky.

That‚Äôs where **Practical Domain Design (PDD)** comes in.

## a. Core Idea: Two Worlds, One Map

Instead of forcing everyone into the same vocabulary or rigid process, PDD accepts reality: business and tech will always speak different dialects.

* Business talks in **departments, workflows, operations, and entities.**
* Devs talk in **modules, actions, services, and models.**

Neither side has to fake fluency. The bridge is a **translation map** that connects the two. It‚Äôs lightweight, visual, and keeps both sides honest.

üëâ Think of it like subtitles on a movie. You don‚Äôt need the actors to change their lines, you just need a reliable translation so everyone follows the same plot.

## b. How PDD Solves the Old Problems

* **Waterfall‚Äôs rigidity** ‚Üí PDD replaces one giant bet with thin slices and feedback loops. You still get structure, but you‚Äôre not locked into a six‚Äëmonth death march.
* **Agile/Scrum fatigue** ‚Üí PDD keeps the good parts (short cycles, collaboration) but trims the theater. No rituals for their own sake - only the loop that proves learning.
* **DDD‚Äôs steep hill** ‚Üí PDD lowers the barrier. Instead of demanding one ‚Äúubiquitous language,‚Äù it gives each side its own baseline and ties them together with a map.
* **Framework inflation (SAFe, LeSS, etc.)** ‚Üí PDD scales up without drowning in overhead. Strategic artifacts work for a 5‚Äëperson team and still make sense in a 5000‚Äëperson enterprise.

PDD doesn‚Äôt fight these methods - it plays nice with them. Want to run Scrum? Great, let PDD‚Äôs baselines feed your backlog. Stuck in a Waterfall shop? Use PDD‚Äôs loop to reduce risk between stages. Love DDD? Keep the modeling discipline, just ditch the vocabulary wars.

## c. Strategic vs Tactical

Classic methods often blur business intent and technical detail. PDD draws a hard line:

* **Strategic Baseline (business reality):** How the business actually runs today - departments, workflows, ops, and entities.
* **Tactical Baseline (code reality):** How the system actually behaves today - modules, actions, services, and models.

Side by side, the gaps and misalignments are impossible to ignore. That clarity is what fuels better decisions.

---

## d. The Loop as Connective Tissue

The real magic isn‚Äôt just the baselines - it‚Äôs the **Loop.**

Every time a new pain point or idea shows up, it runs through the same cycle:

1. Capture it in **business terms** (strategic).
2. Translate it into **technical terms** (tactical).
3. Implement, validate, and demo it back in both languages.

No endless debates. No ceremony creep. Just a repeatable loop that keeps everyone aligned while the system evolves.

üëâ **In short:** Practical Domain Design doesn‚Äôt throw out old methods - it modernizes them. Structure without rigidity. Feedback without theater. Translation without language coups. Two worlds, one map, continuous loops. That‚Äôs the fix.
