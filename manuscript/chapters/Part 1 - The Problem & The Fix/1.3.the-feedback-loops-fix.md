# Chapter 1.3 The Feedback Loops Fix

So if Agile, Scrum, DDD, and all the rest arenâ€™t *wrong*, why do so many teams still crash and burn when they follow them? Because theyâ€™re optimized for theory, not todayâ€™s reality. Most frameworks assume clean backlogs, neat handoffs, and stakeholders who magically speak the same language. Thatâ€™s not how real teams live.

Reality check: todayâ€™s teams are juggling remote work, cloud services, spaghetti legacy systems, and business expectations that change by the week. You donâ€™t need more ceremony. You need a system that keeps everyone aligned even when the ground shifts under your feet.

Thatâ€™s where **Feedback Loops** come in.

## a. Core Idea: Loops, Not Linear

Instead of one-and-done handoffs, Feedback Loops treat design as an ongoing cycle. Each loop is a self-contained engine:

1. **Baseline** â€“ Capture the current state.
2. **Loop** â€“ Run thin-slice experiments from pain point â†’ solution.
3. **Canon** â€“ Lock in what worked as the new truth.

Then repeat. Over and over. The rhythm creates alignment without endless meetings.

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it like muscle memory. The more loops you run, the stronger and faster your team gets.

## b. Two Worlds, Same Pattern

We run **two loops in parallel**:

* **Strategic Loop (Business)** â€“ Captures departments, workflows, operations, and business entities. Produces PRDs and business-facing Practical Domain Design maps.
* **Tactical Loop (Tech)** â€“ Captures modules, actions, services, and models. Consumes PRDs + business maps, then produces code, technical maps, and docs.

Both use the same pattern: Baseline â†’ Loop â†’ Canon. The outputs of one feed the other. Strategic defines the *what* and *where it fits*. Tactical defines the *how*. Together, they keep business and tech in sync without pretending they speak the same language.

## c. Why Feedback Loops Beat Theater

Other frameworks collapse at the handoff:

* Agile devolves into ticket-shuffling.
* Scrum becomes sprint ceremonies with no heartbeat.
* DDD stalls in translation fights over terminology.

Feedback Loops solve this by:

* Making translation explicit through **Practical Domain Design artifacts** (business maps + technical maps).
* Building traceability: every line of code can be traced back to an original pain point.
* Keeping alignment alive: each Canon update refreshes both sides.

## d. In Short

Feedback Loops donâ€™t replace Agile, Scrum, or DDD. They modernize them. Theyâ€™re the glue that keeps strategy and tactics connected, so teams can adapt quickly *without* losing alignment.

* Strategic Loop = design the business.
* Tactical Loop = design the system.
* Canon = the shared, living truth.

Thatâ€™s the fix: **loops instead of theater, artifacts instead of guesses, and alignment that sticks.**
