# Chapter 1.2: Why Popular Methodologies Trip Us Up

Every shiny methodology promises to save us from chaos. Waterfall promised predictability. Agile promised speed. Scrum promised teamwork. DDD promised clarity. And yet, here we are in 2025 — still drowning in rework, mistranslation, and late-night fire drills.

The problem isn’t that these approaches are *wrong*. It’s that they assume conditions that almost never exist in real life: clear requirements, stable goals, and teams who magically speak the same language. When reality doesn’t match the theory, teams stumble into the same traps over and over.

Let’s break it down.

## 1.2.1 Waterfall Woes

Waterfall works when you’re building a bridge. You know the river won’t move halfway through construction. Software? Not so much.

The idea: gather all the requirements upfront, design it all, build it, test it, ship it. Neat, linear, controlled.

The reality: by the time you deliver, the business has changed, the users want something else, and your beautiful plan is already obsolete. Feedback arrives only at the very end, when it’s most expensive to act on. That “predictability” comes at the cost of massive waste.

## 1.2.2 Agile & Scrum Theater

Agile started as a manifesto with values we all agree on. But somewhere along the way, it became cargo cult. Teams measure “velocity” like it’s a blood pressure reading, hold standups that are just status recitals, and run sprint reviews where half the features demoed don’t even matter.

Scrum made it worse by scripting ceremonies into rigid theater:

* Standups: everyone reports what they did, nobody collaborates.
* Sprint reviews: awkward half-demos to polite applause.
* Retros: gripe sessions with no follow-through.

The backlog bloats, the ceremonies keep rolling, and actual alignment fades. You’re agile in name, but in practice it’s theater.

## 1.2.3 DDD: Great in Theory, Hard in Practice

Domain-Driven Design was a leap forward. Finally, a way to make the business and devs talk about the same problems. The artifacts are genuinely useful for developers.

But adoption is brutal. The learning curve is steep, the diagrams are intimidating, and the “ubiquitous language” idea turns into endless arguments about whether to call it a customer, client, or account. Translation debt piles up faster than tech debt.

DDD shines in greenfield projects with time to spare. In messy, fast-moving environments, it often collapses under its own weight.

## 1.2.4 The Common Pitfalls Across All

Different methods, same problems:

* **Translation fatigue** – Business says one thing, tech hears another, and everyone nods while building the wrong thing.
* **Decision ping-pong** – Choices bounce between teams until deadlines make them for us.
* **Lack of traceability** – No clean line from pain point → requirement → code.
* **Ceremony over outcomes** – More focus on rituals than results.

Sound familiar? That’s because the root problem is the same: we keep treating design as a one-time event instead of a continuous process.

## 1.2.5 What We Actually Need

What teams actually need isn’t another methodology layered on top. We need:

* A **lightweight, repeatable system** that doesn’t collapse under real-world chaos.
* A way to **connect business and tech** without forcing them to speak the same language.
* A rhythm that works for both **startups** (fast, messy) and **enterprises** (big, political).

In other words: we need **Feedback Loops.**

Feedback Loops don’t throw out Agile, Scrum, or DDD. They modernize them. They give teams a pattern that works even when the ground shifts under their feet.

That’s where we go next.
