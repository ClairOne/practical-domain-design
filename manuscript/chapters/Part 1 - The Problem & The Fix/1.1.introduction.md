# Chapter 1.1: Introduction / Overview

## Why another book?

Iâ€™ve spent 30 years building software â€” wearing every hat from developer to DBA to product owner. Iâ€™ve seen Agile sprints devolve into ticket shuffles, Scrum ceremonies turn into theater, and DDD grind to a halt in translation debates. I loved the ideas, but in practice they were either too heavy, too vague, or too fragile.

So I built something different: **Feedback Loops.**

Feedback Loops are a lightweight, repeatable way to keep business and tech aligned while you ship software that actually solves the right problems. The core is simple: **Baseline â†’ Loop â†’ Canon.** Capture what is, run a thin slice of change, then lock in what worked as the new truth. Repeat until youâ€™re bored of winning.

And the glue that makes it all practical? **Practical Domain Design (PDD).** These are the artifacts â€” maps and docs â€” that capture how the business and the system really work. Not theory. Not a 200-page spec. Just enough clarity to keep everyone on the same page.

## Who this book is NOT for

This isnâ€™t a Software Development 101 or Project Management 101 book. If youâ€™re looking to learn how to code, manage a sprint board, or figure out what a BA or software architect does from scratch â€” this isnâ€™t it. We assume youâ€™ve been around the block. You already know the basics, the roles, and the lingo.

This book is for skimmers and doers. If you need inâ€‘depth explanations of common software concepts, most of what follows will fly right over your head. We wonâ€™t hold your hand on fundamentals â€” weâ€™ll show you how to run Feedback Loops and build Practical Domain Design artifacts that cut through the noise.

## Who this book is for

If youâ€™re on a small product team drowning in chaos â€” napkin requirements, ops firefights, QA chasing ghosts, devs guessing what the business really wanted â€” this book will give you structure without the overhead.

If youâ€™re in a large enterprise â€” with Jira backlogs that groan under their own weight, committees for every decision, and slide decks that say a lot but change little â€” Feedback Loops scale up. They create traceability from the first pain point all the way to shipped code and back again.

## What this book will teach you

Weâ€™ll walk step by step through:

1. **Spotting the real problem.** Why traditional methods collapse in practice.
2. **Learning the Feedback Loop pattern.** Baseline â†’ Loop â†’ Canon.
3. **Running the Strategic Loop.** Capturing pain points, validating problems, framing vision, and producing a PRD plus business-facing Practical Domain Design.
4. **Running the Tactical Loop.** Translating PRDs into technical design, code, and technical-facing PDD artifacts.
5. **Making it Canon.** How to lock in what worked as the new shared truth.
6. **Keeping it alive.** How to handle drift, growth, and the messy reality of shipping software.

By the end, you wonâ€™t have a binder of theory. Youâ€™ll have a handful of living artifacts, a loop your team can actually run, and a way to evolve design without burning out.

## What next

You can dip into the case studies to see how this plays out in real, funny, and sometimes disastrous situations. Or you can skip ahead to Part 1, where we unpack why popular methodologies trip teams up and how Feedback Loops fix the gaps.

Either way, youâ€™ll be ready to see how this system keeps both business and tech honest, aligned, and moving forward.

ðŸ‘‰ In short: This isnâ€™t another process fad. **Feedback Loops are the engine. Practical Domain Design is the map. Together they make shipping software sane again.**
