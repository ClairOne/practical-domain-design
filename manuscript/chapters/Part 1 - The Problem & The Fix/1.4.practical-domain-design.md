# Chapter 4: Practical Domain Design

Feedback Loops are the engine. But an engine without wheels doesn’t get you far. That’s where **Practical Domain Design (PDD)** comes in. These are the artifacts — the maps and documents — that give shape to the loops. They’re lightweight enough for small teams, structured enough for big enterprises, and always traceable back to the original pain point.

Without artifacts, loops are just meetings. With artifacts, loops create a living body of truth everyone can see, use, and trust.

## a. Why Artifacts Matter

Most teams don’t fail because they lack ideas. They fail because ideas get lost in translation:

* Business says one thing, devs hear another.
* QA tests the wrong acceptance criteria.
* Ops inherits a feature no one explained.

Artifacts fix that. They:

* **Anchor conversations** in shared documents, not opinions.
* **Create traceability** from pain point → PRD → code.
* **Prevent rework** by forcing clarity early, when it’s cheap.

👉 In short: artifacts are the receipts. They prove why you built what you built, and how it ties back to real business problems.

## b. PDD in the Strategic Loop

On the business side, loops generate these artifacts:

* **Business Pain Point Entry (PPE)** – Catch the smoke early.
* **Problem Validation Brief (PVB)** – Prove the fire is real.
* **Vision & Problem Statement (VPS)** – Paint the better world.
* **Requirements Brief (RB)** – Define what must be true.
* **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** – Package the bet we’re making.
* **Business Map (Strategic PDD)** – Place the solution in context: departments → workflows → operations → entities.

This last step is critical. The PRD describes the solution in isolation. The Business Map shows where it fits in the larger system and exposes potential conflicts before they reach code.

## c. PDD in the Tactical Loop

On the tech side, loops consume the Strategic artifacts and produce Tactical ones:

* **Inputs:** PRD + Business Map.
* **Outputs:**

  * **Technical Map (Tactical PDD)** – Modules → Actions → Services → Models.
  * **Code** – The working system that meets the business need.

Example:

* Business Map: *Workflow → Manage Teams; Operation → Team.addCoach; Entity → Team.*
* Technical Map: *Module → Team; Action → ManageTeam; Service.Function → TeamService.addCoach(); Model → Team.*

The mirroring makes traceability automatic. Business designs in their terms, tech implements in theirs, and the maps line up without forcing a “ubiquitous language” nobody actually uses.

---

## d. The Symmetry

Strategic and Tactical PDD artifacts are mirrors:

* **Department ↔ Domain/Module**
* **Workflow ↔ Action**
* **Operation ↔ Service.Function**
* **Entity ↔ Model**

This symmetry is what makes PDD powerful. It lets each side work in their own language while keeping the maps aligned. Every pain point can be traced all the way to a line of code, and every line of code can be traced back to a business problem.

## e. In Short

Feedback Loops keep the system moving. **Practical Domain Design provides the map.** Together they:

* Keep business and tech aligned without forcing them to fake fluency.
* Prevent “lost in translation” disasters.
* Ensure every solution fits both the business context and the codebase.

👉 Loops are motion. PDD is structure. That’s how you ship features that work, make sense, and don’t torch your weekends.
