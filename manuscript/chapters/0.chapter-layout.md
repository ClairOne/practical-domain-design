Here’s a clean, funnel-style outline for the **Strategic Domain Design** chapter. Each section builds on the last like steps in a sales journey - you start with “why should I care?” and end with “here’s how we live with it long-term.” I’ve also added what you lose if you cut a section.

# 📘 Strategic Domain Design - Chapter Outline

### Section 1: Introduction / Overview

**Value:** Sets the stage. Explains what Strategic Domain Design even is, why it matters, and promises the reader “this won’t be another dry theory dump.”
**If skipped:** Readers won’t know what they’re signing up for or why they should keep turning pages. They’ll bounce.

---

### Section 2: The Problem We’re Trying to Solve

**Value:** Paints the pain in vivid color - translation fatigue, Agile Theater, midnight releases. Helps the reader say, “yep, that’s us.”
**If skipped:** PDD looks like a random new framework instead of a cure for their real headaches.

---

### Section 3: How PDD Solves It

**Value:** Introduces PDD as the antidote. High-level principles, not yet the gritty details. Think promises, not processes.
**If skipped:** PDD feels like a hammer in search of a nail. Readers won’t connect it to their problems.

---

### Section 4: Getting Started With a Baseline

**Value:** Explains the “day 1 snapshot.” Baseline docs and why we freeze the mess before fixing it. Gives small teams a low-cost on-ramp.
**If skipped:** Teams dive straight into process changes without a map of where they started. Harder to measure improvement and avoid chaos.

---

### Section 5: Begin the Loop

**Value:** The beating heart of PDD - short, feedback-driven cycles. Shows how teams actually move from baseline to better.
**If skipped:** PDD devolves into another static design doc exercise instead of a living system. Readers never see how learning drives design.

---

### Section 6: Making It Canon

**Value:** Explains how lessons from the loop get promoted into the new “source of truth.” Prevents endless churn.
**If skipped:** Teams either get stuck in permanent loop mode (never stabilizing) or lock in bad decisions too early.

---

### Section 7: Living With It (Scaling, Drift, and Renewal)

**Value:** Helps teams understand what happens after adoption - how to keep the canon fresh, deal with team growth, or reboot the baseline if things drift.
**If skipped:** PDD looks like a one-and-done playbook, not a sustainable practice. Readers won’t know how to adapt when reality changes.

---

👉 In short: the outline flows like a customer journey -

* **Why care** (Intro + Problem)
* **Why this works** (PDD Solution)
* **How to start** (Baseline)
* **How to improve** (Loop)
* **How to lock in** (Canon)
* **How to sustain** (Living With It)

Do you want me to **expand each section into 2-3 sample paragraphs** in book voice so you can see how the flow actually reads, or keep it at this outline level for now?
