# 5.0 Getting Started with PDD

Okay, enough theory. Let’s talk about what you actually need to get PDD off the ground. Spoiler: you don’t need a six-figure consulting engagement or a 300-page training manual. You need a couple of roles, a clear sense of your situation, and the discipline to keep the loop running. That’s it.

## a. Minimum Setup

The beauty of PDD is that it’s **lightweight on purpose.** You don’t need to reorganize the company or buy fancy tools. You can start with:

- A shared doc or whiteboard tool (Notion, Miro, Google Docs - doesn’t matter).
- Your existing backlog system (Jira, Trello, sticky notes on the wall).
- A team willing to spend 1–2 hours mapping how things *actually* work.

If you’ve got those, you can start. No excuses.

## b. Roles (aka Hats People Already Wear)

PDD doesn’t require you to invent fancy new job titles. You already have these roles on your team - we’re just shining a light on the hats they need to wear inside the loop.

- **Business Mapper**: This is your BA, Product Owner, or whoever actually knows how the business runs (warts and all). Their job in PDD is to capture workflows and entities in plain language, not corporate poetry.
- **Tech Mapper**: Usually a lead dev or senior engineer. They know where the codebase’s bodies are buried and can map modules, services, and models without hand-waving.
- **Loop Facilitator**: Think “Scrum Master without the burn-down chart fetish.” Their job is to keep the cycle moving, make sure business and tech maps stay aligned, and call BS when people start drifting into Agile Theater. On small teams, this can rotate or just fall to whoever’s best at herding cats.

👉 The point isn’t new titles. The point is coverage. If no one is wearing a hat, that perspective gets ignored - and your loop collapses.

## c. PDD Situations

Before you dive into mapping, figure out which **situation** your team is in. PDD flexes to fit, but the starting point changes:

### 1. Existing Business + Existing Software

*Example: A SaaS company that’s been live for 5 years. Customers are happy enough, but the codebase has grown into a patchwork quilt. You need to document what you have and improve it without blowing everything up.*

- **Strategic:** Baseline + Loop → Canon
- **Tactical:** Baseline + Loop → Canon
  👉 Document what exists (warts and all), then improve it incrementally.
  *Remodeling the house while you still live in it.*

---

### 2. Green Field (New Business + New Software)

*Example: Two founders with an idea for a marketplace app. No existing business processes, no codebase. You’re starting from zero.*

- **Strategic:** Loop → Canon
- **Tactical:** Loop → Canon
  👉 No baseline exists. The loop is both discovery and design.
  *Building on an empty lot.*

---

### 3. Existing Business + New Software (no pre-existing software)

*Example: A manufacturer that’s been tracking orders with spreadsheets and email threads. The business is humming, but now they want to build their first internal system.*

- **Strategic:** Baseline + Loop → Canon
- **Tactical:** Loop → Canon
  👉 Document the business, then treat the software side as green field.
  *Like digitizing a company that’s been running on paper binders.*

---

### 4. Existing Business + Re-write of Existing Software

*Example: A retailer stuck with a 15-year-old ERP system that crashes weekly and can’t keep up with new sales channels. It’s too brittle to patch anymore, so the only real option is a rebuild.*

- **Strategic:** Baseline + Loop → Canon
- **Tactical:** **Condensed Baseline (reference only)** + Loop → Canon
  👉 Capture the legacy system only as a **reference** to avoid repeating its mistakes. Build fresh tactical canon through the loop.
  *Tearing down a moldy house. Keep the inspection report, but don’t reuse the foundation.*

---

### Decision Checklist

Not sure which path you’re in? Use this quick guide:

* If you’ve got **business + software in production**, you’re in **Situation 1**.
* If you’ve got **no business and no software**, you’re in **Situation 2**.
* If you’ve got **business but no software yet**, you’re in **Situation 3**.
* If you’ve got **business + terrible software you need to replace**, you’re in **Situation 4**.

👉 When in doubt, pick the one that feels least optimistic. PDD works best when you face the messy reality head-on.

## Why This Matters

Most teams fail because they start too heavy. They try to roll out DDD workshops, big design sessions, or enterprise tooling before they’ve even proven the basics. PDD flips that: start minimal, keep artifacts tight, and let the loop prove its value.

In short: PDD doesn’t need a reorg. It just needs a map, a loop, and a team that agrees to keep it honest.
