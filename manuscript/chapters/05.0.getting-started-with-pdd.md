# 5.0 Getting Started with PDD

Okay, enough theory. Let’s talk about what you actually need to get PDD off the ground. Spoiler: you don’t need a six-figure consulting engagement or a 300-page training manual. You need a couple of roles, a few simple artifacts, and the discipline to keep the loop running. That’s it.

## a. Minimum Setup

The beauty of PDD is that it’s **lightweight on purpose.** You don’t need to reorganize the company or buy fancy tools. You can start with:

- A shared doc or whiteboard tool (Notion, Miro, Google Docs - doesn’t matter).
- Your existing backlog system (Jira, Trello, sticky notes on the wall).
- A team willing to spend 1–2 hours mapping how things *actually* work.

If you’ve got those, you can start. No excuses.

## b. Roles (aka Hats People Already Wear)

PDD doesn’t require you to invent fancy new job titles. You already have these roles on your team - we’re just shining a light on the hats they need to wear inside the loop.

- **Business Mapper**: This is your BA, Product Owner, or whoever actually knows how the business runs (warts and all). Their job in PDD is to capture workflows and entities in plain language, not corporate poetry.
- **Tech Mapper**: Usually a lead dev or senior engineer. They know where the codebase’s bodies are buried and can map modules, services, and models without hand-waving.
- **Loop Facilitator**: Think “Scrum Master without the burn-down chart fetish.” Their job is to keep the cycle moving, make sure business and tech maps stay aligned, and call BS when people start drifting into Agile Theater. On small teams, this can rotate or just fall to whoever’s best at herding cats.

👉 The point isn’t new titles. The point is coverage. If no one is wearing a hat, that perspective gets ignored - and your loop collapses.

## c. Artifacts

Don’t panic. These aren’t 40-page documents. They’re quick, structured snapshots that evolve over time:

1. **Business Baseline** – Departments, workflows, operations, entities. Direct and to the point.
2. **Code Baseline** – Modules, actions, services, models. Even when the code doesn’t fit the pattern.
3. **Translation Map** – The bridge between the two baselines. Think nested lists, not UML nightmares.
4. **Loop Backlog** – A running list of pain points and ideas captured in business terms, then translated into tactical tasks.

👉 If you can show these four things on a single screen and a new hire says, “Oh, now I get how this works,” you’re golden.

## Why This Matters

Most teams fail because they start too heavy. They try to roll out DDD workshops, big design sessions, or enterprise tooling before they’ve even proven the basics. PDD flips that: start minimal, keep artifacts tight, and let the loop prove its value.

In short: PDD doesn’t need a reorg. It just needs a map, a loop, and a team that agrees to keep it honest.
