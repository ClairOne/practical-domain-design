# 7.1.1 Concept: Establish The Tactical Baseline - Documenting the Code

Every dev team thinks they know their codebase… until they try to map it. Suddenly, that “simple” membership feature runs through three controllers, a job, a helper class, and an Eloquent model with more business logic than the product owner ever imagined.

That’s why we start the Tactical Phase with a Baseline. This isn’t about refactoring or cleaning yet. It’s about taking a clear snapshot of how the code actually works today — hacks, shortcuts, god classes, and all.

Think of it like making a field guide: you can’t explore the jungle safely until you know which paths exist and which plants will give you a rash.

### The Four Building Blocks

When documenting the code, we care about four concrete pieces:

1. **Modules** – The big buckets of code. In Laravel, this might be `App/Domain/Orders` or `App/Domain/Teams`. In a legacy mess, it might just mean “everything under `Controllers/` that sorta belongs together.”
2. **Actions** – The entry points that do real business work. In clean apps these are explicit `Action` classes. In messy ones, they might be controller methods (`TeamController@update`), queued jobs, or artisan commands packed with logic. If it kicks off a workflow, it’s an Action.
3. **Services** – Reusable logic units. In nice systems these are service classes with single responsibilities. In less nice ones, they’re helpers, utilities, or giant “manager” classes that quietly run half the app. Either way, call them out.
4. **Models** – The nouns of your system. Laravel’s Eloquent models, custom DTOs, or whatever is pretending to be the thing. Even if your models are overweight with business rules, document them as they are.

👉 The rule of thumb: Modules hold Actions. Actions call Services. Services operate on Models. If you can’t see that chain, your baseline isn’t finished.

### Putting It All Together

Here’s a small Tactical Baseline for a fictional Teams module:

``` 
Module: Teams
  Actions:
    - TeamController@update
    - InviteController@create

  Services:
    - TeamService.updateName()
    - InviteService.send()

  Models:
    - Team
    - Invite
    - Athlete

```

👉 Just like the Strategic side, this is the **scratchpad view**. It’s quick, nested lists that give you a fast way to capture what’s really in the codebase without debating polish.

When you’re ready to formalize it, you’ll switch to the **structured templates in the appendix** (Module Detail, Action Detail, etc.). Those templates provide the consistency needed for sharing across the team, but the core structure stays the same: Modules → Actions → Services → Models.

Think of it as messy field notes vs a cleaned-up field guide. Both matter. The notes help you explore, the guide helps everyone else navigate.

### Success Criteria

You know your Tactical Baseline is “good enough” when:

- A new dev could trace a feature from Action → Service → Model without getting lost.
- No one on the team says “oh wait, you forgot the thing in Helpers.php.”
- Each module baseline fits on a single screen. If it sprawls, split it into sub-baselines (e.g. “Teams Baseline,” “Billing Baseline”).
- You can point from each operation in the Strategic Baseline to its match here.

### Why It Matters

Most teams think they know their code until they try to map it. That’s when the blind spots show up: duplicate services, controllers hiding core business logic, models overloaded with side effects.

The Tactical Baseline forces the code into daylight. It gives you a shared mental model of what’s actually running in production — good, bad, and ugly. And that shared map is the only way the Loop can work.

👉 In short: Don’t refactor yet. Don’t make it pretty. Just document reality so you can start fixing it, one backlog item at a time.
