# Chapter 2.1.0 Strategic Baseline Overview

Every loop starts with a **Baseline**. For the Strategic Loop, that means capturing how the business really works today — not the glossy slide deck version, not the wishful-thinking version, but the messy, duct-taped, real-world version.

Think of the Baseline as your starting map. You can’t plan a road trip if you don’t know where you’re starting. The Strategic Baseline is that “you are here” marker.

## Purpose

The Strategic Baseline provides a shared snapshot of business reality:

* **Departments** – The big buckets of responsibility.
* **Workflows** – The repeatable processes those departments run.
* **Operations** – The atomic steps inside workflows.
* **Entities** – The nouns the business cares about (customers, invoices, tickets, etc.).

It’s not about fixing anything yet. It’s about agreeing on the current state so you have a foundation to build from.

## Burning Questions It Answers

* What are the major departments we rely on?
* What workflows actually happen day to day?
* What operations make those workflows run?
* What business entities do we touch across teams?

## Why It Matters

Without a baseline, every conversation becomes a game of telephone. Marketing swears support “always” drops tickets, support says billing is the bottleneck, billing blames sales. Nobody has the same picture.

The Strategic Baseline kills the guessing game. It makes the invisible visible. Once it’s documented, you can:

* Spot overlaps and conflicts across departments.
* Onboard new people without 3 weeks of tribal-knowledge download.
* Build traceability into future loops.

👉 It’s the difference between arguing about what’s true and agreeing on what’s real.

## In Short

The Strategic Baseline is your starting map. It doesn’t solve problems — it shows you where you actually are. And without it, every loop risks starting from fantasy instead of reality.
