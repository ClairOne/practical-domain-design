# Chapter 2.0.0 Strategic Feedback Loop Overview

The **Strategic Feedback Loop** is where business reality gets captured, tested, and translated into living artifacts. It’s not about wishful thinking or future-state diagrams. It’s about running a repeatable cycle that turns raw pain points into validated business designs everyone can agree on.

The pattern is the same as every loop in this book: **Baseline → Loop → Canon.**

## Purpose

The Strategic Loop gives the business side of the house a clear rhythm:

* **Baseline:** Capture how the business *actually* runs today (departments, workflows, operations, entities).
* **Loop:** Take new pain points, validate them, shape vision, define requirements, and produce a PRD plus a Strategic PDD (Business Map).
* **Canon:** Lock in what worked as the new shared truth, so the next loop starts from reality, not fiction.

This isn’t BA theater. It’s structured momentum. Each cycle creates artifacts that are small, lightweight, and traceable all the way to tactical work.

## Burning Questions It Answers

* How do we capture what’s really happening in the business without drowning in documentation?
* How do we know which problems are real and worth solving?
* How do we ensure the “fix” fits into the bigger business picture?
* How do we keep everyone aligned as the business evolves?

## Why It Matters

Most teams either under-document (chaos) or over-document (paralysis). The Strategic Loop threads the needle: just enough structure to prevent waste, but not so much that you spend all day making diagrams nobody reads.

It also creates **traceability**:

* Pain Point → Validation → Vision → Requirements → PRD → Strategic Domain Design → Canon.

That chain of custody means when someone asks “why are we building this?” you don’t shrug — you point straight to the artifact trail.

## In Short

The Strategic Feedback Loop is the business engine of PDD. It keeps pain points from getting lost, turns ideas into validated requirements, and maps them into the business context before anything ever hits code. It’s how business stops lobbing requests over the wall and starts co-owning the design of the system.
