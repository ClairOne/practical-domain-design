# 2.2.4 Requirements Brief

The Vision & Problem Statement gave us the north star. The Requirements Brief (RB) is where we translate that vision into clear, testable requirements the whole team can agree on. It‚Äôs not about design or solutions yet - it‚Äôs about drawing the lines that define what ‚Äúdone‚Äù really means.

---

## Purpose

The RB exists to **turn vision into business-level requirements that are clear, scoped, and testable.** It ensures everyone agrees on the problem definition, goals, constraints, and success indicators before tactical design begins.

---

## Audience (Hats)

The RB is owned by **Product**, with strong input from:

* **Business Owner** ‚Äì sets the boundaries of value
* **QA Lead** ‚Äì ensures requirements are testable
* **Ops/Support** ‚Äì highlights operational impacts
* **Dev Lead** ‚Äì sanity-checks feasibility
* **Compliance/Legal** ‚Äì if applicable, ensures constraints are captured

üëâ Think of this as the handshake document across all roles before anyone writes code.

---

## Burning Questions It Answers

* **What must be in scope?** The core capabilities needed to realize the vision.
* **What must stay out of scope (for now)?** The guardrails to prevent scope creep.
* **What business rules and constraints matter?** Compliance, timelines, budgets, technical realities.
* **What risks are lurking?** Dependencies or threats that could derail progress.
* **What does success look like?** Clear acceptance signals agreed on by all.

---

## Why It Matters

Projects go off the rails when scope and rules are fuzzy. The RB prevents that by forcing clarity early. It also builds traceability: every requirement ties back to the validated problem and vision. Later, when questions come up (*‚ÄúWhy are we building this?‚Äù*), the RB provides the receipts.

It‚Äôs also the antidote to endless back-and-forth during sprints. With clear, business-level requirements, QA and devs can test outcomes instead of guessing intent. Everyone saves time.

üëâ **In short:** The Requirements Brief is your contract for clarity. It keeps scope creep out, ties requirements back to vision, and defines what ‚Äúdone‚Äù means before anyone touches code.
