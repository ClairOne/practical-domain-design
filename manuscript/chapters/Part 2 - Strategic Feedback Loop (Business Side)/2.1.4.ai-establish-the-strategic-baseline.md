# Chapter 2.1.4 Strategic Baseline – AI Assisted

Sometimes you don’t want to wrangle sticky notes and whiteboards. Maybe your team is remote, maybe nobody wants to play facilitator, or maybe you just want the artifacts to come out clean from the start. That’s where the **AI-assisted version of the Strategic Baseline** comes in.

The process is the same as the manual SOP, but instead of stopping at scratchpads, you feed raw notes into prompts that generate polished baseline docs. The AI doesn’t replace judgment — it just handles the grunt work of formatting, structuring, and cross-referencing.

## ✅ Quick Checklist

1. Use the **Interview Prompt** to gather raw notes from department owners and SMEs. Capture the messy, conversational version of “how we actually work.”
2. Feed those notes into the **Department Detail Prompt** to structure each department’s map of workflows, operations, and entities.
3. For workflows needing more depth, run the **Workflow Detail Prompt** to expand into operations and entity touchpoints.
4. Review the AI outputs as a group — check accuracy, fill gaps, and correct mistakes.
5. Save the generated docs as your baseline artifacts (Department Detail, Workflow Detail, etc.).

## 🔧 Prompt Map

| Step                  | Output Artifact           | Prompt to Use            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Capture messy reality | Strategic Baseline notes  | Interview Prompt         |
| Structure departments | Department Detail drafts  | Department Detail Prompt |
| List workflows        | Workflow Detail drafts    | Workflow Detail Prompt   |
| Break into operations | Workflow + Operations map | Workflow Detail Prompt   |
| Capture entities      | Entity List (baseline)    | N/A (list only)          |
| Assemble baseline     | Strategic Baseline Map    | Combine outputs above    |

👉 See the Appendices for copy-paste ready prompt templates.

## Success Criteria

* AI outputs structured, consistent docs for every department.
* Group review and validation is complete (AI is fast, not infallible).
* Everyone agrees the docs reflect *reality*, not just AI guesses.
* Entities are captured as a simple list for now — detailed docs come later during the Loop.

👉 In short: Run the same workshop flow, but let AI handle the documentation grunt work. Humans still confirm what’s true, but you’ll walk away with clean, shareable artifacts in a fraction of the time.
