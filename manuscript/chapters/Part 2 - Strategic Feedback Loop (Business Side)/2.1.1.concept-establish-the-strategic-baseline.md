# Chapter 2.1.1 Strategic Baseline – Documenting the Business

Every team thinks they know how their business runs… until they try to write it down. Suddenly the “simple” billing process has six hidden detours, and Support’s “standard” workflow turns out to be fifty shades of chaos.

That’s why every **Strategic Feedback Loop** starts with a **Baseline**. This isn’t about fixing anything or debating best practices. It’s about taking a snapshot of how the business actually operates today — warts, duct tape, and all.

Think of it like a map: you can’t plan a road trip until you know where you’re starting. The Baseline is that “you are here” marker.

## The Four Building Blocks

When documenting the business, capture four simple pieces:

* **Departments** – Big buckets of responsibility.
* **Workflows** – The repeatable processes those departments run.
* **Operations** – The atomic steps inside each workflow.
* **Entities** – The nouns the business deals with every day.

That’s it. No buzzwords. Just the terms people already use.

## Artifacts

Feedback Loops give you structure with flexibility. Each template plays a role at a different stage:

* **🧠 Strategic Baseline – Brain Dump**: Capture Departments, Workflows, Operations, and Entities in one messy table. Don’t worry about gaps. Just dump it.
* **🏢 Department Detail**: Zoom into each department. Describe what it does, who runs it, and the workflows it owns.
* **⚙️ Workflow Detail**: For each workflow, nail down the trigger, goal, and step-by-step operations.

👉 Think of it as layers: Brain Dump for breadth, Department Detail for context, Workflow Detail for depth. Pick the layer you need. That’s the flexibility of PDD — structured enough to guide you, loose enough to adapt.

## Success Criteria

You know your baseline is “good enough” when:

* You can show it to a new hire and they nod instead of squinting.
* Nobody in the room says “that’s not how we do it.”
* Each department or module fits on a single screen. If it sprawls, split into sub-baselines instead of one giant hairball.

---

## Why It Matters

* **Shared reality:** Everyone stops pretending they know how things work and actually sees it on paper.
* **Foundation for backlog:** You can’t capture pain points if you don’t know the workflows they belong to.
* **Low effort, high return:** Two hours of mapping saves weeks of guesswork later.

---

👉 In short: The Baseline is just holding up a mirror. Don’t polish it. Don’t overcomplicate it. Just capture what *is*. The fixing comes later, in the Loop.
