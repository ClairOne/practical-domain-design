# 2.3.0 Strategic Domain Design

The PRD defines *what* solution weâ€™re betting on. Strategic Domain Design (SDD) defines *where that solution lives in the business* and *how it interacts with the rest of the system.*

This is the bridge between the Strategic Loop and the Tactical Loop. Itâ€™s where we zoom out and ask: does this solution fit cleanly into the business, or are we about to create workflow collisions and role confusion?

---

## Purpose

SDD ensures that every PRD-backed solution slots neatly into the business model: departments, workflows, operations, and entities. It adds context that prevents well-meaning fixes from causing bigger problems elsewhere.

---

## Burning Questions It Answers

* What **departments** does this PRD touch?
* Which **workflows** are involved, and who owns them?
* Where are the **crossovers** or potential conflicts?
* Which **operations** (steps) are required?
* Which **business entities** are impacted?
* Who is **allowed** to perform these workflows and operations? (roles & permissions)
* Under what **context** can those operations be performed?

---

## Why It Matters

PRDs are written in isolation - they describe a problem and solution, but not always how it interacts with the larger business. Thatâ€™s fine for speed, but dangerous for alignment.

SDD is the safeguard. It lets business stakeholders see cross-workflow and cross-department conflicts *before* the Tactical team ever touches code.

Example:

* Josh (League Manager) can create teams and add staff.
* Bill (Head Coach of Anoka Trap Team) can add or remove staff for his own team, but not for others.

Both rules sound fine in a PRD. But when mapped in SDD, you see they live in the same **Team Management workflow**. If not clarified, the system might allow head coaches to modify other teams, creating chaos.

---

## The Mapping

Strategic terms map directly to Tactical terms:

* **Department â†’ Domain/Module**
* **Workflow â†’ Action**
* **Operation â†’ Service.Function**
* **Business Entity â†’ Model**

This one-to-one mapping is what allows the business to design the system in their own language, while IT focuses on implementing it in code. Think architect (business) and builder (IT).

---

## Deliverable

An SDD artifact is usually a structured map or table. Example:

**Department: League Management**

* **Workflow:** Manage Teams

  * **Operations:** `Team.create`, `Team.addCoach`, `Team.addStaff`
  * **Entities:** Team, Staff, Coach
  * **Roles/Permissions:**

    * League Manager: all operations
    * Head Coach: only staff operations for their own team

This rolls up into the same structure used on the Tactical side, which makes traceability automatic.

## Whatâ€™s Next

This overview is enough for small teams to see the value and slot solutions into the bigger picture.

For larger or more complex orgs, weâ€™ll dive deeper in the next sections:

* **2.3.1 Departments** â€“ define the big buckets and owners
* **2.3.2 Workflows** â€“ capture repeatable processes per department
* **2.3.3 Operations** â€“ break workflows into verb + entity steps
* **2.3.4 Entities** â€“ list the nouns that flow through operations

ðŸ‘‰ **In short:** PRD defines the solution in isolation. SDD defines its place in the business. Itâ€™s how Feedback Loops ensure that solutions donâ€™t just work - they fit.
