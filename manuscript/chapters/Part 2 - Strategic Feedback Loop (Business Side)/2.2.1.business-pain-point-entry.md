# 2.2.1 Business Pain Point Entry

Every fire starts with smoke. The Business Pain Point Entry (PPE) is how we catch that smoke early - before the fire spreads, before the backlog fills with noise, and before everyone is arguing over symptoms instead of causes.

This is the very first artifact in the Strategic Loop. It‚Äôs deliberately lightweight: a single page that captures what hurts, who it hurts, and how bad it stings. Nothing fancy, nothing polished - just enough clarity to make sure the problem doesn‚Äôt get lost.

---

## Purpose

The PPE exists to **capture pain points in business terms.** It turns vague complaints into structured input the team can track and act on. If you don‚Äôt capture the pain clearly here, the rest of the Loop risks chasing the wrong problem.

---

## Audience (Hats)

Anyone close to the work should be able to submit a PPE:

* Support agents hearing customer complaints
* Ops staff spotting bottlenecks
* Finance noticing billing errors
* Product managers seeing churn risks
* Engineers hitting repeated friction

üëâ If you see smoke, you can file a PPE. Titles don‚Äôt matter - proximity to the problem does.

---

## Burning Questions It Answers

* **What hurts?** A crisp description of the problem.
* **Who‚Äôs feeling it?** The team, customers, or both?
* **How bad does it sting?** The immediate impact on time, money, or sanity.

These sound simple, but nailing them early prevents weeks of rework later. You either spend 5 minutes here or 5 weeks after release when the ‚Äúfix‚Äù didn‚Äôt actually fix the real problem.

## Why It Matters

Skipping PPE means relying on tribal knowledge and hallway conversations to carry business problems forward. That‚Äôs a recipe for translation fatigue, forgotten details, and mismatched expectations. A simple entry creates traceability - every artifact downstream ties back to the original pain point, building a clean chain of custody from complaint to solution.

PPE also builds momentum. It gives the reporter a quick win, and it gives the team something concrete to validate. With the AI prompts we provide, you can go from a vague one-liner to a clear PPE in under 5 minutes.
