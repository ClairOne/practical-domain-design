# 2.2.3 Vision & Problem Statement

The Problem Validation Brief (PVB) proved the fire is real. The Vision & Problem Statement (VPS) is where we decide what a better world looks like once the fire is out - and why it matters strategically. It connects the validated problem to a motivating, measurable future state.

---

## Purpose

The VPS exists to **paint the better world and tie it to strategy.** It reframes the problem into a vision the business can rally around, defines measurable objectives, and shows how this effort aligns with company goals.

---

## Audience (Hats)

The VPS is typically crafted and owned by the **Business side**, with input from:

* **Business Owner / Product Lead** ‚Äì drives the vision
* **Finance** ‚Äì ensures alignment with budgets and ROI
* **Ops / Compliance** ‚Äì surfaces constraints
* **Customer / Stakeholder Reps** ‚Äì ground the vision in reality
* **Engineering Lead** ‚Äì consulted for feasibility checks

üëâ This is where strategy, not tactics, takes center stage.

---

## Burning Questions It Answers

* **Where do we want to go?** What does success look like in concrete terms?
* **Why now?** What‚Äôs the urgency or driver making this worth doing?
* **How does this tie to company goals?** If it doesn‚Äôt ladder up, why bother?
* **What constraints matter?** Budget, compliance, or technical realities that can‚Äôt be ignored.

## Why It Matters

Vision without measures is just a pep talk. Measures without vision lead to local optimizations that miss the point. The VPS locks both together. It gives leadership a quick, strategic read (*‚Äúdoes this matter to the business?‚Äù*) and gives teams a north star to navigate by.

It also anchors everything that follows: requirements, PRDs, tactical designs. Without a clear VPS, you risk building things that solve the wrong problem or solve the right problem in a way no one cares about.
