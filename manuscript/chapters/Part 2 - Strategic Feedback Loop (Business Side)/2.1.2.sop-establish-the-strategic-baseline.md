# Chapter 2.1.2 Strategic Baseline – SOP

The **Strategic Baseline** is the first step of the Strategic Feedback Loop. Think of it as building a simple map of how your business really works — not the slide-deck fantasy, not the way leadership *wishes* it ran, but the way it actually runs day to day.

This isn’t theory. It’s an SOP you can follow like a recipe. By the end, you’ll have a set of lightweight artifacts that make the invisible visible.

## ✅ Quick Checklist

1. Gather the team in a room (or a shared doc).
2. Brain dump all departments.
3. Assign an owner to each department.
4. Brain dump workflows under each department.
5. Split into department huddles to break workflows into operations and entities.
6. Each team assembles a scratchpad map for its department.
7. Owners present maps, group provides feedback.
8. Collect and refine Department Detail docs.

That’s it. One session gets you from fuzzy guesses to a shared Strategic Baseline.

## Step 1 – Brain Dump Departments (and Assign Owners)

* List **all departments** in the business.
* Ask: “If payroll cuts a check for it, is it a department?”
* Assign a business owner — not necessarily a manager, but the person who knows the work well enough to own the map.

**Output artifact:** A list of departments with assigned owners.

👉 Don’t debate org charts. Focus on functional buckets of work.

---

## Step 2 – Brain Dump Workflows

* For each department, list its repeatable processes.
* Ask: “When X happens, what do we do that results in Y?”
* Keep it short and high-level.

**Output artifact:** A rough list of workflows under each department.

👉 Capture what people *say* they do. Refinement comes later.

---

## Step 3 – Break Workflows into Operations

* Split into department huddles.
* Break each workflow into **operations** (verb + entity, e.g., `Invoice.create`).
* If it takes branches or approvals, it’s a separate workflow.

**Output artifact:** A short list of operations under each workflow.

---

## Step 4 – Capture Entities

* Entities are the **nouns** your business touches (Customer, Invoice, Ticket).
* Scan operations for nouns and list them.
* Note where entities cross department lines — overlaps matter later.

**Output artifact:** A list of entities for each department.

---

## Step 5 – Assemble Scratchpad Maps

* Map each department: Departments → Workflows → Operations → Entities.
* Don’t worry about size or balance.

**Output artifact:** A Strategic Baseline scratchpad map per department.

👉 Uneven maps aren’t wrong — they’re clues. Overloaded? Under-defined? Both are signals for future loops.

---

## Step 6 – Present and Review

* Department owners present their maps.
* Group asks: “Does this look real? What’s missing? Who else is impacted?”
* Capture updates live.

**Output artifact:** Validated Department Detail docs.

---

### Success Criteria

Your baseline is ready when:

* A new hire nods instead of saying, “That’s not how we do it.”
* Each department has an owner confirming workflows.
* Differences across maps point to questions, not confusion.

👉 In short: Don’t polish the map to make it pretty. Capture what’s real. Messy beats imaginary every time.
