# 2.2.2 Problem Validation Brief

A Business Pain Point Entry (PPE) captures the smoke. The Problem Validation Brief (PVB) is where we check if there‚Äôs an actual fire. Not every complaint deserves a project, and not every pain point is worth fixing right now. The PVB separates the real problems from the noise.

---

## Purpose

The PVB exists to **validate** whether a pain point is real, significant, and worth solving. It pulls in evidence, quantifies impact, and gets stakeholders aligned. Without this step, teams waste months chasing anecdotes or politics.

---

## Audience (Hats)

The PVB is owned and driven by the **Product/Business side**, but it pulls in voices from:

* **Product** ‚Äì framing the problem clearly
* **Analytics/Data** ‚Äì pulling proof from metrics and logs
* **Finance** ‚Äì confirming cost/ROI impacts
* **Ops/Support Leads** ‚Äì confirming the problem shows up in daily work

üëâ Engineering may be consulted for feasibility hints, but the PVB is about proving the problem exists in business terms.

---

## Burning Questions It Answers

* **Is this pain real?** Do we have concrete evidence, not just opinions?
* **Can we prove it?** What observations and metrics back this up?
* **What‚Äôs the cost of ignoring it?** If we leave this alone, how bad will it get?
* **Who agrees?** Which stakeholders sign off that this is a real problem worth solving?

---

## Why It Matters

Skipping validation is how ‚Äúzombie projects‚Äù are born - initiatives with no evidence, no measurable impact, and no defenders once things get tough. The PVB keeps the backlog honest. It makes sure energy only goes into problems with proof, alignment, and stakes.

PVBs also act as insurance. Later, when someone asks *‚ÄúWhy are we working on this?‚Äù* you can point back to the evidence, quantified impact, and stakeholder alignment. No more shrugging or digging through old Slack threads.

üëâ **In short:** The PVB is your bullshit filter. It separates signal from noise, backs it with evidence, and ensures everyone agrees the fire is real before you call in the fire brigade.
