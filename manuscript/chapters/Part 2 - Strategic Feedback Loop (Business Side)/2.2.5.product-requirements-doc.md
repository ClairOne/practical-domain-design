# 2.2.5 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

The Requirements Brief defined what must be true for success. The Product Requirements Document (PRD) is where those requirements are packaged into a single, business-facing spec that‚Äôs clear, testable, and ready for the tactical side to pick up without guesswork.

---

## Purpose

The PRD exists to **package the business solution in a way that‚Äôs ready for tactical translation.** It ties together the validated problem, the vision, and the requirements into a coherent business solution definition. If the PRD is fuzzy, the tactical work will be chaos.

---

## Audience (Hats)

The PRD is owned by **Product**, but it requires tight alignment from:

* **Business Owner** ‚Äì confirms the solution matches the vision and ROI case
* **QA Lead** ‚Äì ensures acceptance criteria and metrics are testable
* **Dev Lead** ‚Äì sanity-checks feasibility before tactical planning
* **Ops/Support** ‚Äì validates operational impacts and readiness
* **Compliance/Legal** ‚Äì ensures regulatory constraints are captured

üëâ This is the last stop before translation into technical design and backlog items.

---

## Burning Questions It Answers

* **What solution are we betting on?** The chosen business approach in plain terms.
* **Which capabilities and rules must exist?** The non-negotiables for the solution to work.
* **How will we measure success?** Clear KPIs and acceptance criteria that define ‚Äúdone.‚Äù
* **What risks or dependencies need attention?** Early warning before tactical planning starts.

---

## Why It Matters

If you can‚Äôt articulate the business solution clearly at this stage, you‚Äôre setting the tactical team up for endless interpretation and rework. The PRD is the handshake between strategy and tactics - the artifact that makes sure everyone is betting on the same horse before the race begins.

It also locks traceability: every line in the PRD ties back to the Requirements Brief, Vision, and Validation. No orphan requirements, no *‚Äúwhere did this come from?‚Äù* features.

üëâ **In short:** The PRD is the handshake between strategy and tactics. It‚Äôs the last chance to lock clarity before translation into code. If it‚Äôs solid here, the tactical team runs smooth. If it‚Äôs fuzzy, welcome to chaos.
