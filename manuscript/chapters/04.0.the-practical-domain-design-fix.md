# 4.0 The Practical Domain Design Fix

So if DDD isn’t broken, why are so many teams breaking *on* it? Because they’re trying to use it like it’s still 2003. Back then, monoliths ruled, deployments were rare, and most of the design patterns we now treat as table stakes hadn’t even been named yet.

Today, we build in a different world: APIs everywhere, distributed systems, devs juggling cloud, CI/CD pipelines, and “why is staging down again?” alerts at 2 a.m. Trying to run classic DDD in this context is like trying to text from a flip phone. The idea still works - but the interface is clunky.

That’s where **Practical Domain Design (PDD)** comes in.

## a. Core Idea: Two Languages, One Map

Instead of forcing everyone into one “ubiquitous language,” PDD takes the opposite approach: let each side keep speaking their native tongue.

- Business speaks in **departments, workflows, operations, and entities**.
- Devs speak in **modules, actions, services, and models**.

Neither side has to fake fluency. The bridge is a **translation map** that connects the two. It’s lightweight, visual, and keeps both sides honest.

👉 Think of it like subtitles on a foreign film. You don’t need the actors to switch languages. You just need a clear, reliable translation that makes sure everyone’s watching the same story.

## b. Strategic vs Tactical

Classic DDD lumps everything into “the domain.” PDD splits it into two clear phases, each with its own baseline and loop:

- **Strategic Phase (business reality):** Capture how the business actually runs - departments, workflows, ops, and entities. No “ideal future state,” just the messy now.
- **Tactical Phase (code reality):** Capture how the codebase actually works - modules, actions, services, and models. No “shoulds,” just what’s there today.

This two-baseline approach keeps business and dev honest. Later, when you lay them side by side, the gaps and misalignments jump out.

## c. The Loop as Connective Tissue

The real magic isn’t the baselines - it’s the **Loop.**

Every time a new pain point or idea comes in, it runs through the same cycle:

1. Capture it in **business terms** (strategic side).
2. Translate it into **technical terms** (tactical side).
3. Implement, validate, and demo it back in both languages.

No endless debates. No Agile Theater. Just a repeatable feedback loop that keeps both sides in sync without pretending they’re the same thing.

👉 In short: Practical Domain Design isn’t about reinventing DDD. It’s about modernizing it. We keep the spirit - alignment between business and code - but update the practice for today’s world. Two languages, one map, continuous translation. That’s the fix.
