# 6.1.4 SOP: Establish The Strategic Baseline (AI-Assisted)

Sometimes you don’t want to wrangle sticky notes and whiteboards. Maybe your team is remote, maybe nobody wants to play facilitator, or maybe you just want the artifacts to come out clean from the start. That’s where the AI-assisted version of the Strategic Baseline comes in.

This is the same process as the manual SOP, but instead of stopping at scratchpads, you feed your raw notes into prompts that generate polished baseline docs. The AI doesn’t replace the team’s judgment - it just handles the grunt work of formatting, structuring, and cross-referencing.

## ✅ Quick Checklist

1. Start with the **Interview Prompt** to gather raw notes from department owners and SMEs. This helps capture the messy, conversational version of “how we actually work.”
2. Feed those interview notes into the **Department Detail Prompt** to structure each department’s map of workflows, operations, and entities.
3. For each workflow that needs more depth, run the **Workflow Detail Prompt** to expand it into operations and entity touchpoints.
4. Review the AI outputs as a group - check for accuracy, fill in missing details, and correct mistakes.
5. Save the generated docs as your baseline artifacts (Department Detail, Workflow Detail, etc.).

## 🔧 Prompt Map

| Step                  | Output Artifact            | Prompt to Use              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Capture messy reality | Interview notes            | Interview Prompt           |
| Structure departments | Department Detail doc      | Department Detail Prompt   |
| Expand workflows      | Workflow Detail doc        | Workflow Detail Prompt     |
| Assemble baseline     | Department + Workflow docs | Combine outputs from above |

👉 See the Appendices for the actual prompt templates. They’re copy-paste ready.

## Success Criteria

* The AI outputs structured, consistent docs for every department.
* The group has reviewed and validated them (don’t skip this - AI is fast, not infallible).
* Everyone agrees the docs reflect *reality*, not just what the AI guessed.

👉 In short: Run the same workshop flow, but let AI handle the documentation grunt work. You still need human brains to confirm what’s true, but you’ll walk away with clean, shareable artifacts in a fraction of the time.
