# 6.1.1 Concept: Establish The Strategic Baseline - Documenting the Business

Every team thinks they know how their business runs… until they try to write it down. Suddenly the “simple” billing process has six secret detours, and Support’s “standard” workflow turns out to be fifty shades of chaos.

That’s why we start PDD with the **Baseline**. This is not about fixing anything. It’s not about debating best practices. It’s about taking a clean snapshot of how the business actually operates today — warts, duct tape, and all.

Think of it like a map: you can’t plan a road trip until you know where you’re starting. The Baseline is that starting point.

## The Four Building Blocks

When documenting the business, we care about four simple pieces:

1. **Departments** – The big buckets of responsibility.
2. **Workflows** – The repeatable processes each department runs.
3. **Operations** – The tasks inside each workflow.
4. **Entities** – The nouns the business deals with every day.

That’s it. No fancy jargon or synergistic buzzwords. Just business terms people already use.


---

### 1. Departments

Departments are the easiest place to start. If the company cuts paychecks for it, it’s a department.

- Sales
- Billing
- Support
- HR
- Operations

👉 Write them down as a list. Don’t argue about org charts or reporting lines. We just want the functional buckets of work.


---

### 2. Workflows

Workflows are the **repeatable processes** a department runs. Each workflow has a clear start, a series of operations, and an end.

Think of a workflow as a **story**: *When X happens, we do Y, which results in Z.*

Examples (Billing Department):

- **Generate Invoice** → (operations: `Invoice.create`, `Invoice.send`)
- **Handle Dispute** → (operations: `Dispute.open`, `Dispute.resolve`)
- **Send Payment Reminder** → (operations: `Reminder.create`, `Reminder.send`)

👉 If you can’t describe it as “When this event happens, we perform these steps to get to an outcome,” it’s not a workflow.

Workflows are the backbone of the Strategic Baseline. Later, when we connect them to the Tactical Baseline, you’ll see how each workflow coordinates a set of operations inside the code.


---

### 3. Operations

Operations are the **atomic steps** inside a workflow. Each one is a single action taken against a business entity. They should be short, concrete, and verb-heavy.

Examples:

- `Team.updateName`
- `Invite.create`
- `Season.changeRegistrationCloseDate`

👉 If an “operation” takes multiple checks, approvals, or branches, it’s not an operation - it’s a workflow.

Operations are where the business world starts to line up with the technical world. In the Tactical Baseline, these will map to **Business Entity Services** - e.g. “Update Team Name” becomes `TeamService.updateName()`.


---

### 4. Entities

Entities are the nouns your team touches. Customers, Invoices, Products, Tickets, Orders.

**Example (Billing Entities):**

- Customer Account
- Invoice
- Payment Method

Entities often cross department lines. That’s a good thing. Later, when we compare the business baseline with the code baseline, those overlaps will expose gaps and misalignments.

### Putting It All Together

Here’s a small Strategic Map for a fictional Billing department:

``` 
Department: Billing
  Workflows:
    - Generate Invoice
        Operations:
          - Validate customer hours
          - Calculate totals
          - Issue invoice
        Entities:
          - Customer Account
          - Invoice
          - Payment Method

    - Send Payment Reminder
        Operations:
          - Identify overdue accounts
          - Generate reminder notice
          - Email customer
        Entities:
          - Customer Account
          - Invoice

```

👉 Notice how it’s just nested lists. Nothing fancy. This is the **scratchpad view** - the kind of quick sketch you’d throw together in a session to get the basics on paper.

Later, when you need to clean it up and share with others, you’ll use the **structured templates in the appendix** (Department Detail, Workflow Detail, etc.). Those templates give you consistency and clarity across the team, but the spirit is the same: Departments → Workflows → Operations → Entities.

Think of it as rough notes vs polished docs. Both are valid, just used at different moments in the loop.

## Success Criteria

You know your baseline is “good enough” when:

- You can show it to a new hire and they nod instead of squinting.
- No one in the room says “that’s not how we do it.”
- Aim to keep each department or module baseline on a single screen. If the map sprawls, break it into sub-baselines (e.g. “Billing Baseline,” “Membership Baseline”) instead of one giant hairball.


---

## Why It Matters

- **Shared reality:** Everyone stops pretending they know how things work and actually sees it on paper.
- **Foundation for backlog:** The next step (The Loop) builds on this. You can’t capture pain points if you don’t know the workflows they belong to.
- **Low effort, high return:** Two hours of mapping saves weeks of guesswork later.


---

👉 In short: The Baseline is just holding up a mirror. Don’t polish it. Don’t overcomplicate it. Just capture what *is*. We’ll worry about fixing things in the Loop.
