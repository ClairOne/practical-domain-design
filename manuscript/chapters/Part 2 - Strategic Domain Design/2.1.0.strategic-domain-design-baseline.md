# 📘 Chapter 2.1.0: Strategic Domain Design - Baseline

**Why you need a baseline**
Before you start changing anything, you need to see the mess as it really is. Most teams blow past this step because it feels slow or boring. But if you don’t freeze a snapshot of your current reality, you’ll never know what actually improved - you’ll just be swapping one flavor of chaos for another.

Think of it like renovating a house: you take “before” photos not because they’re pretty, but because later they prove all the sweat was worth it.

**What a baseline gives you**
The baseline captures the business problems and decisions in flight right now. Done right, it gives you:

* **A common reference point** - everyone agrees on “this is where we are.”
* **A safe starting line** - you can experiment without losing track of the original problem.
* **Evidence for improvement** - proof that the loop is actually paying off.

**How to build your baseline**
You don’t need a six-month discovery crusade. You just need to answer a few blunt questions and capture them in living artifacts:

* **Business Pain Point** - What’s the real hurt? Phrase it in plain English.
* **Problem Validation Brief** - How do we know this hurt is real and worth fixing?
* **Vision & Problem Statement** - Where are we trying to go, and why?
* **Requirements Brief** - What’s essential to fix, without boiling the ocean?
* **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** - The first structured record of the bet we’re making.

If your team can crank out a single page for each, congratulations: you’ve got a baseline.

**Pitfalls to avoid**

* Don’t turn this into a months-long discovery marathon. The point is speed, not perfection.
* Don’t let artifacts rot on a shelf. If nobody updates them, they’re just paperwork.
* Don’t skip validation. If you can’t prove the pain is real, you’re solving the wrong problem.

**Learn How It Works**
Start with the Practical Strategic Domain Design core concepts. That’s the playbook that explains why this isn’t just more paperwork and how it ties your business together.

**Learn How To Do It**
Crack open the SOP. Think of it as the recipe card: step-by-step, no fluff, just what you need to get cooking.

👉 In short: The baseline isn’t busywork - it’s the “before photo” that makes progress visible. Skip it, and you’re just running in circles and calling it strategy.
