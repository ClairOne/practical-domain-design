# Chapter 2.1.2 SOP: Establish The Strategic Baseline - Documenting the Business

The Strategic Baseline is where PDD starts. Think of it as building a simple map of how your business really works - not the slide-deck fantasy, not the way leadership *wishes* it ran, but how it actually runs day to day.

This isn’t theory. It’s an SOP you can follow like a recipe. By the end, you’ll have a set of artifacts that make the invisible visible.

## ✅ Quick Checklist

1. Gather the whole team in a room.
2. Brain dump all departments across the business.
3. Assign an owner to each department.
4. Brain dump workflows under each department.
5. Split into department-level huddles to break workflows into operations and entities.
6. Each team assembles a scratchpad map for its department.
7. Break for review: department owners present their maps, the group provides feedback.
8. Collect and refine Department Detail docs for all departments.

That’s it. Now let’s go step-by-step.

## Step 1 - Brain Dump Departments (and Assign Owners)

* Gather everyone together and list **all departments** in the business.
* Ask: “If payroll cuts a check for it, is it a department?”
* Write down department names (e.g., Billing, Sales, Support).
* **Assign a business owner** to each department - the person who will take responsibility for the workflows in that department.

**Why this matters:**

* Creates a single point of contact to confirm reality:

  * “Yes, my department does that.”
  * “No, that belongs to Jane’s team.”
* Helps the team start visualizing the company as structured roles instead of everyone doing everything.
* Sets you up for Tactical later when scopes, roles, and permissions come into play.

**Output artifact:** A list of departments with assigned owners.

👉 Pro tip: Don’t get stuck debating org charts. Owners aren’t necessarily managers. They’re the person who knows the work well enough to own the map.

---

## Step 2 - Brain Dump Workflows

* For each department, list the repeatable processes it runs.
* Ask: “When X happens, what do we do that ends with Y outcome?”
* Keep them short, e.g.:

  * Generate Invoice
  * Handle Dispute
  * Send Payment Reminder

**Output artifact:** A rough list of workflows under each department.

👉 This is still high-level. Don’t overthink. Capture what people *say* they do. You’ll refine later.

---

## Step 3 - Department Deep Dive (Operations)

* Split into department-level huddles (still in the same room).
* Take the workflow list for your department and break each workflow into **operations**.
* Each operation = **verb + entity** (e.g., `Invoice.create`, `Dispute.resolve`).
* Keep it short. If a step has multiple branches or approvals, that’s probably a separate workflow.

**Output artifact:** A short list of operations under each workflow.

---

## Step 4 - Capture Entities

* Entities are the **nouns** your business touches (Customer, Invoice, Payment Method).
* Go back through the operations you listed - the nouns are usually right there.
* Write them down under the department.

**Output artifact:** A list of entities for that department.

👉 Entities often show up in multiple departments. That’s good - it’ll expose gaps later when you compare baselines.

---

## Step 5 - Assemble Scratchpad Maps

* Each department team assembles its own map: Departments → Workflows → Operations → Entities.

**Output artifact:** A Strategic Baseline scratchpad map for each department.

👉 Don’t stress about size. If one department has 138 workflows and another has 3, leave it that way. The number isn’t “wrong” - it’s a clue.

* A huge list might mean the department is overloaded, or it might just mean you’ve defined workflows too narrowly.
* A tiny list might mean the department is well-bounded, or it might mean you’ve missed detail.

Either way, the map shows you something important about how the business actually functions. That visibility is gold.

---

## Step 6 - Present and Review

* Have department owners present their maps while everyone else listens.
* Encourage questions and clarifications:

  * “Does this look like reality?”
  * “What’s missing?”
  * “Who else is impacted by this?”
* Capture feedback and update the maps in real time.

**Output artifact:** Department Detail docs for each department, validated by the group.

### Success Criteria

You know your baseline is ready when:

* A new hire can look at it and nod instead of saying, “That’s not how we do it.”
* Every department has an owner who can confirm the workflows.
* The maps may be uneven across departments - and that’s fine. The differences themselves often tell you where to ask better questions later.

👉 In short: Don’t trim the map to make it “look nice.” Capture what’s real. Mess, imbalance, and lopsidedness are all useful signals for future backlog items.
