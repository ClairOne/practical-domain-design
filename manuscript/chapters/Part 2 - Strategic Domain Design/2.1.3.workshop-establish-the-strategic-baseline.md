# Chapter 2.1.3 Workshop: Establish The Strategic Baseline - Documenting the Business

This isn’t a stiff agenda, it’s a playbook. The goal: get everyone in a room, cut through the fantasy versions of “how we work,” and by lunch you’ll have real artifacts instead of hot air.

---

## 🕘 9:00 – Kickoff (15 min)

* Welcome the group.
* Explain the goal: *“By lunch, no more mystery workflows hiding under the carpet. We’ll have a map of how this circus really runs.”*
* Quick overview of the process: Brain dump → Deep dive → Present & review.

---

## 📝 9:15 – Brain Dump Departments & Workflows (45 min)

* Gather everyone in a room with whiteboards or a shared doc projected.
* Step 1: List all departments.
* Step 2: List the main workflows under each department.
* Assign an owner for each department.
* Stop when most heads are nodding and nobody’s starting a fistfight.

**Output:** A master list of departments, owners, and high-level workflows.

## 👥 10:00 – Department Huddles: Deep Dive (60 min)

* Split into department-level groups (still in the same room).
* Each group:

  * Breaks workflows into operations.
  * Captures entities touched by those operations.
  * Assembles a scratchpad map (Dept → Workflows → Operations → Entities).

**Facilitator’s role:** Float between groups, answer questions, and keep the wheels turning when energy dips.

**Output:** Department scratchpad maps.

## 🍴 11:00 – Lunch & Department Presentations (60 min)

* As people eat, department owners present their maps one by one.
* Encourage blunt but constructive feedback:

  * “Does this look like reality?”
  * “What’s missing?”
  * “Who else is impacted by this?”
* Update maps live based on feedback.

**Output:** Validated Department Detail docs.

---

## ✅ 12:00 – Wrap-Up & Next Steps (15 min)

* Recap what was captured.
* Highlight any obvious gaps or lopsided departments (signals for backlog).
* Explain where this leads: *“These baselines set us up for the next PDD phase.”*

**Final Output:** A complete Strategic Baseline across departments, ready for use in the PDD Loop.

👉 In short: Half a day, lock the team in a room, and walk out with artifacts that actually reflect reality instead of PowerPoint fantasy.
