# 2.0 Who This Book Is For

This book is for practitioners - the people who have to live with the code and the business every single day.

- Product owners who are sick of being translators for both sides.
- Developers who are tired of vague feature requests turning into fragile spaghetti.
- QA folks who find themselves guessing at the “real” workflow.
- Ops teams who inherit brittle systems nobody fully understands.

If you’ve tried to apply Domain Driven Design (DDD) in a small team and hit a wall of business resistance, you’re in the right place. If you’ve seen features rushed from idea to demo with little context, only to trigger endless rework, this book will feel uncomfortably familiar.

And let’s set the record straight: this isn’t a takedown of Agile or DDD. Quite the opposite. We’re big fans of both. Agile was a huge leap forward - when it’s done right, it gives teams speed, adaptability, and sanity. Same with DDD: when Eric Evans put it out into the world, it was groundbreaking. It gave us a vocabulary for mapping messy business problems into code. Two decades later, it’s still brilliant in the right context.

But here’s the rub: neither Agile nor DDD is *easy*. Agile gets watered down into ceremony without substance. DDD gets stuck in endless debates over terminology and feels impossible for small teams to implement fully.

Practical Domain Design (PDD) doesn’t try to replace them. It builds on them. Think of it as DDD evolved for the messy, fast-paced reality of small teams in 2025. We keep the spirit - alignment between business and code, feedback loops, working software over fluff - but update the practice to fit today’s world.

PDD provides the missing structure: a way for business to speak in its own terms, for developers to speak in theirs, and for both sides to stay aligned without pretending they share one universal language. It takes the good ideas of DDD, cuts the overhead, and plugs them into the rhythms of Agile so the loop actually works.

In short: If you’re done firefighting and ready to make delivery boring (in the best possible way), this book is for you.

### 👉 Why Not Just Use DDD?

Don’t get us wrong: we love Domain Driven Design. It was a game-changer when it came out, and it’s still brilliant in the right context. But here’s why small teams often struggle to pull it off:

- **The “one language” myth.** Business and devs rarely converge on a single vocabulary. Meetings turn into word-policing sessions instead of progress.
- **It’s heavy.** Full-blown DDD can feel like a consulting project all by itself. Small teams don’t have the time or headcount to run it by the book.
- **Translation fatigue.** Without clear mapping, “Send Payment Reminder” in the backlog becomes `retryPayment()` in code. Everyone’s half right and completely misaligned.

**PDD isn’t anti-DDD.** It’s DDD with a reality check. We keep the good ideas (clear models, alignment, feedback loops) but strip out the overhead and force-fit jargon.
