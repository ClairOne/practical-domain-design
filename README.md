## 📖 About the Book
**Practical Domain Design (PDD)** is a feedback-driven way to deliver features with fewer late-night disasters.  
It builds on Agile and Domain Driven Design (DDD), but trims the overhead to fit the messy, fast-paced reality of small teams.  

- Business speaks in departments, workflows, operations, and entities.  
- Devs speak in modules, actions, services, and models.  
- PDD builds a **map between the two** and runs everything through a continuous feedback loop.  

👉 In short: PDD makes delivery **boringly predictable** — which is the highest compliment in software.
