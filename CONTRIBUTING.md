# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in *Practical Domain Design*! 🎉  

This repo contains the **draft manuscript** of the book. It’s here for version control, transparency, and feedback.  
It is **not** an open-source project — but we do welcome feedback through GitHub Issues.

## 🚫 What Not To Do
- Don’t open pull requests (PRs).  
- Don’t fork this repo for derivative works.  
- Don’t copy, redistribute, or republish content (see `COPYRIGHT.md`).

## 🙌 How To Give Feedback
We use **GitHub Issues** as the single channel for feedback.  

### ✅ What belongs in an Issue:
- **Clarity problems**: “This section confused me because…”  
- **Tone/style feedback**: “This bit felt too corporate compared to the Author Voice.”  
- **Examples needed**: “Could use a concrete Laravel example here.”  
- **Typos or formatting**: Catch ‘em all.  

### 📝 Issue format (please copy/paste)
```markdown
**Chapter:** [e.g. 02-who-this-is-for.md]  
**Section:** [optional line/paragraph if relevant]  
**Feedback:** [your comment]  
**Suggestion (optional):** [how you’d improve it]
````

### ❌ What doesn’t belong:

* General chit-chat.
* “When’s it coming out?” (Answer: when it’s boringly predictable.)
* Pull requests with edits.

---

## 🛠 Internal Workflow

For authors/editors (Dave + Gary):

* Drafts live in `manuscript/chapters/`.
* One chapter = one Markdown file.
* Assets (images, diagrams) go in `assets/`.
* Tools for exporting (Pandoc, Leanpub configs, etc.) live in `tools/`.
