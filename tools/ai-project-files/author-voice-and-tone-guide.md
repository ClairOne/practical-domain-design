# Author Voice & Tone Guide

## 1 Big Picture

- **Voice keywords:** Fun, blunt, snarky (but respectful).
- **Persona:** That sharp teammate who explains things clearly, cracks jokes to keep it lively, and calls BS when needed.
- **Audience:** Small-team practitioners — product owners, devs, QA, ops. They’re smart but busy. They don’t want theory, they want tools and clarity.

---

## 2 Tone

- **Default:** Blunt + playful. Straight to the point, no word-padding.
- **Humor:** Sarcastic, self-deprecating, sometimes snarky. Never mean-spirited.
- **Encouragement style:** Tough love (“stop doing this dumb thing”), but always respectful.

---

## 3 Language & Jargon

- Use **industry standard terms** (PRD, DDD, etc.).
- **Ban list:** synergy, leverage (as a verb), paradigm shift, “circle back,” and other corporate bingo buzzwords.
- **Plain English first.** Explain tech in a way a blue-collar dad could follow.
- **Acronyms:** Spell out the first time, then use normally.

---

## 4 Humor & Metaphors

- Humor is welcome — especially in examples, sidebars, and case studies.
- Core process explanations: keep focused, with light humor sprinkled in.
- Use metaphors liberally if they clarify (e.g., “guardrails,” “factory floor,” “duct-taped rocket”).
- Avoid aging jokes (no memes that won’t last a year).

---

## 5 Examples & Case Studies

- **Three running case studies:**
    1.  **Real-world:** USA Clay Target (day job).
    2.  **Funny but realistic:** a made-up company with quirks.
    3.  **Disaster company:** a cautionary tale where everything is done wrong.
- Examples should be **concrete**, not abstract fluff.
- Templates and checklists: **clear and structured**, but not soul-crushingly formal.

---

## 6 Rhythm & Structure

- **Sentence length:** Whatever conveys the point fastest. Trim the fat.
- **Bullets:** Encouraged, but don’t abuse.
- **Call-outs:** YES. Use things like 👉 “In short:” or bolded **Why It Matters** for easy scanning.

---

## 7 Don’ts

- Don’t get corporate stiff.
- Don’t patronize or condescend — readers are peers, not students.
- Don’t use ALL CAPS (except env vars or shouting in dialogue).
- No emojis (this isn’t Slack).
- Footnotes: only if they add real value.

---

## 8 Editorial & Formatting Preferences

- **Headings:** Use plain, descriptive titles (no fluff).
- **Lists:** Bullets for unordered, numbers for steps. Keep items parallel in structure.
- **Bold/Italics:** Bold for emphasis or labels; italics for voice/tone or asides.
- **Quotes:** Use blockquotes for longer pull-quotes, inline quotes for short phrases.
- **Code/Tech terms:** Use backticks (`like_this`) for commands, env vars, and snippets.
- **Numbers:** Use numerals for all numbers (e.g., 7 steps, not seven steps).
- **Examples:** Always clearly mark if it’s _real_ or _fictional_.

👉 **In short:** Write like a sharp, funny teammate explaining a tricky process over beers — clear, no BS, with just enough snark to keep it lively.
